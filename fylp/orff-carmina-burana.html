		<h2>Carl Orff <em>Carmina Burana</em></h2>
		<p>
			As one of the most popular of all major choral works, Carl Orff's
			<em>Carmina Burana</em> is well represented in available recordings.
		</p>
		<h3 id="ozawa">Seiji Ozawa</h3>
		<div class="pgraph">

			-->
			<p>
				If you choose to own only one recording, Ozawa's most recent version (Philips 422 363-
				2) is a winner. Every aspect of the performance is exuberant and energized, colorful and
				alive. The Shinyukai Choir sings flawlessly—there is consummate precision in pitch,
				diction, blend and musical shaping and direction of phrase—and yet, this is a
				performance that has no hint of being over-controlled. Appropriately, the affect is fresh
				and youthful. One should note that the choir sings this performance from memory, and
				the resulting tightness of ensemble (all eyes are on the conductor all the time!) is
				stunning. The soloists are all top-notch, with Thomas Hampson's abbot thoroughly
				arresting. Edita Gruberová sings seductively and ease and control from the depths of the
				In trutina to the soaring Dulcissime. There is also an excellent commercial video that
				was filmed live in concert close to the same time as the studio audio recording was made,
				though the video features Kathleen Battle as soprano soloist rather than Gruberová.
				Sonics are excellent with a fairly close presence, though good spatial perspective is
				maintained.

		<h3 id="blomstedt">Herbert Blomstedt</h3>
		<div class="pgraph">
			<p>
				Herbert Blomstedt's recording with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra and Chorus is
				a strong contender in a crowded field (London 430 509-2). As Penguin puts it, the scope
				is "grand" and "opulent," and all the performers seem to be "enjoying themselves
				hugely." The spirit and vigor of the performance lay to rest any preconceptions of
				Blomstedt as an intellectual if somewhat detached conductor. All this is especially
				pleasing, given that the contract situation for this recording was close to "we'll do a
				Nielsen cycle with you and your orchestra if you record a digital Carmina for us."
				Happily, there is imagination and verve in this performance, and Blomstedt emphasizes
				to great effect, the contrasts of color, affect, and dynamic. The trio of soloists are
				uniformly strong, and the childrens choruses are excellent. An enthusiastic
				recommendation for the local team!
			</p>

		<h3 id="previn">André Previn</h3>
		<div class="pgraph">
			<p>
				Since its release, André Previn's 1975 reading on (EMI CDC 7 47411 2) has always remained
				at or near the top of the recommended list. Though not always the cutting edge in
				precision, in variety of choral tone color and energetic presentation, the London
				Symphony Orchestra Chorus is unmatched. The tenors' Ecce gratum, while not the most
				beautiful, is indeed the "blaze of color" that the text proclaims. Sheila Armstrong's
				soprano is beguiling and inviting. Her In trutina is understated and ravishing, and her
				Dulcissime is honey-toned, open and easy all the way to the high D. Baritone Thomas
				Allen is at his best in this recording, his Abbot's song arrestingly dramatic and his
				Estuans interius characteristically dark and burning. Only tenor Gerald English's
				roasting swan song is uncomfortable—but then how would you feel if you were a bird
				being roasted for dinner? The boy's choir from St. Clement Danes Grammar School
				lends a colorful and earthy contribution to the proceedings - not at all the typical English
				boy's choir sound. This recording is a wonderful example of an older analog recording
				that sonically outshines much of its more contemporary all digital competition. The
				sound is brilliant but not hard, spatial characteristics are excellent with front to back
				imaging quite wonderful, and the spotlighting of orchestral soloists from the ranks of the
				London Symphony Orchestra is handled in a most subtle and tasteful manner. 25
				separate tracks on the CD make for easy navigation in this highly sectionalized piece.
				Previn also has a new version recorded in 1994 (Deutsche Grammophon 439 950-2)
				which I have not yet had the opportunity to audition.

		</div>
		<h3 id="fruhbeck">Rafael Frühbeck</h3>
		<div class="pgraph">
			<p>
				Rafael Frühbeck de Burgos presents a rhythmically vital performance—perhaps the most
				"live" sounding (spontaneity-wise) of all the studio recordings currently available. This
				1965 recording (EMI CDM 7 69060 2) was produced in conjunction with London performances
				which utilized the exact same forces at the same time. The New Philharmonia
				Chorus sing with an uncanny rhythmic assuredness, accommodating Burgos' flexible
				tempi without any hint of constraining the conductor from carrying out his wishes. Lucia
				Popp is an especially sweet-timbred soprano, and the tenor, Gerhard Unger brings what
				Penguin characterizes as "Lieder-like sensitivity" to his tavern scene solo. Baritone duty
				is handled admirably by Raymond Wolansky except for the Dies, nox et omnia which is
				stylishly sung by John Noble. The Wandsworth School Boy's Choir sing beautifully, although
				they sound a bit out of place—something like an Anglican cathedral choir transplanted
				to bawdy 13th century Bavaria. As Penguin notes, the CD remastering is not entirely
				successful, with a hard, glassy edge to the sound not at all evident in the excellent
				vintage LP (Angel 36333, if you enjoy hunting the used record stores).
			</p>
		</div>
		<h3 id="shaw">Robert Shaw</h3>
		<div class="pgraph">
			<p>
				Robert Shaw's 1981 recording (Telarc CD-80056) arguably boasts the most polished
				choral singing among current releases. The Atlanta Symphony Chorus sing with
				consistent energy and poise, though with a more homogenized and uniform (and
				somewhat less characterful) presentation throughout than their English rivals above. The
				team of soloists is consistently strong, though recorded somewhat flatly and unnaturally
				closely relative to the chorus and orchestra. Soprano Judith Blegen suffers the least from
				this unkind treatment while baritone Håken Hagegard does not fare as well. Tenor
				William Brown displays more control, especially in the register changes, than Gerald
				English does on Previn's recording. The Atlanta Boy Choir holds its own against any of
				its European rivals and in fact, display more sensitivity to ensemble than do Previn's
				boys. Shaw's tempos are lively though there is not the rhythmic flair and flexibility that
				Ozawa and Burgos display. Unfortunately, the CD is divided into only four tracks (each
				track is indexed by separate section within the larger movements) so that searching for
				specific sections can become somewhat tedious. The liner notes offer a new scholarly
				translation of the text prepared by Jeffrey Dubin of the Goethe Institute in Atlanta at
				Shaw's request.

		<h3 id="others">Others</h3>
		<div class="pgraph">
			<p>
				Other excellent versions are offered by Muti—intense and fiery (EMI CD: CDC 7 47100
				2), Jochum—splendor and excitement (Deutsche Gramophon CD: 423 886-2), and
				Slatkin—power and weighty strength (RCA 09026-61673-2)
