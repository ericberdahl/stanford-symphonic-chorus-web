	<h2 id="joining">Joining the Chorus</h2>
	<p>
		The Stanford Symphonic Chorus is open to all students, faculty,
		staff and any other residents of the community interested in singing
		wonderful music.
	</p>
	<p>
		Members who are not students or faculty pay a modest {% if site.data.programs.current.fees.registration %}(currently
		{{site.data.programs.current.fees.registration}}){% endif %} participation fee. This money helps
		to offset expenses, the largest of which is hiring orchestras.
	</p>

	<h3 id="auditions">Auditions</h3>
	<p>
		New members are normally accepted by audition at the beginning of
		each academic quarter.
		If you are interested in auditioning for the chorus for the
		{{site.data.programs.current.quarter}} quarter, please email
		{% include people_citation.html person=site.data.people.administrator subject="Regarding auditions" %}
		.
	</p>

	<p>Auditions take about ten minutes, are very "user-friendly," and consist of:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Vocalizing (singing scale passages, or similar) with piano
			support to determine range.
		</li>
		<li>
			Pitch memory exercises (we'll play three or four notes in
			sequence on the piano, and you sing them back).
		</li>
		<li>
			Picking pitches out of a chord texture (we play three pitches
			simultaneously on the piano, and ask you to sing the highest,
			middle, or lowest pitch).
		</li>
		<li>Simple sight singing</li>
		<li>
			30 seconds to a minute of a prepared song. This can be anything
			that you enjoy singing: art song, aria, musical theatre number,
			jazz tune, hymn tune, children's song, or the ever popular
			choices of: first verse of <em>My country 'tis of thee</em>,
			<em>Amazing Grace</em>, <em>Edelweiss</em>, etc.
		</li>
	</ul>
	{% if site.data.programs.current.limits.membership %}
	<p>
		NB: Due to facilities restrictions, the Symphonic Chorus is capped
		at a <em><strong>maximum of {{site.data.programs.current.limits.membership}} members</strong></em>.
		For potential new members wishing to join the ensemble, please
		understand that members who have made the full year-long commitment
		in previous seasons have first priority. New members will be
		accepted as space allows, with voice part and section balances taken
		into account.
	</p>
	{% endif %}

	<h2 id="c3">Expectations</h2>

	<h3 id="c4">Learning the Music</h3>
	<p>Each singer is expected to learn the music assigned for each
		rehearsal on his or her own. Beyond the first reading of a work,
		rehearsal time will be devoted to the development of ensemble
		sound, interpretation, and other musical matters. It is further
		expected that each singer will make a reasonable effort to develop
		his or her own vocal skills, and will make every effort to
		contribute in a positive manner to the work of the group.</p>
	<h3 id="c5">Concert Dress</h3>
	<p>
		Men wear tuxedos or a tuxedo-like suits (i.e., black; not grey,
		brown or blue), white shirt, black bow tie, black shoes and socks.
		Women wear all black: long dress, or long black skirt or slacks
		with long-sleeved (preferably) or short-sleeved black blouse, and
		black shoes. Please <strong>no sleeveless tops</strong> and <strong>no
			flashy jewelry.</strong>
	</p>
	
	<h3 id="c6">Covering Your Music</h3>
	<p>
		For performances music must be put in a black folder or notebook, or bound with a black cover.
		Don't wait until the last minute to find a cover which will be practical in performance! (See <a href="#folders">Music Folders</a> on this page for resources.)
	</p>

	<h3 id="Aroma">
		<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link nofragrance.html %}">Fragrance-Free Policy</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		Several people in the chorus are particularly sensitive to scented
		products such as perfume and hair spray; all of us have to sing in
		close quarters and benefit by having air to breathe which is as
		pure as possible. On all rehearsal days, and especially on dress
		rehearsal and performance days, we request you do not use any such
		products. For further information, including information on
		obtaining scent-free alternatives, see
		<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link nofragrance.html %}">extensive guidelines.</a>
	</p>

	<a id="Schedule"></a>
	<h2 id="c7">Rehearsals</h2>
	<p>
		Rehearsals are held Monday evenings from 7:30 to 10:00 in Campbell
		Recital Hall in the Braun Music Building, but please be <em>early</em>
		for the first rehearsal, since it will take extra time to get
		everyone signed up and to distribute the music, which will be
		available at the rehearsal. Sign ups start at <strong>6:30 p.m.</strong>
	</p>

	<p>
		In addition, there are optional but warmly encouraged
		sectional rehearsals on selected Wednesday evenings from 5:30 to
		6:30. Just before the performance we typically have two
		"dress rehearsals," also mandatory, when we rehearse
		with the orchestra, usually in the hall in which we will be
		performing. Concert dress is not required or even recommended at
		these rehearsals. Other rehearsals are typically accompanied by
		piano only.
	</p>

	<p>
		Members may miss up to two required rehearsals during the
		quarter. Members who miss more than two required rehearsals without
		prior arrangement with the director will not be allowed to
		participate in the performance. You must notify the director in
		advance if for any reason you must miss all or part of a rehearsal.
		For those participating for graded credit, every two unexcused
		absences may result in the lowering of the final grade by one
		letter.
	</p>

	<h3>Music</h3>
	<p>The music to be performed is always available at the first three rehearsals.</p>

	<h3>Parking</h3>
	<p>
		Parking for rehearsals can usually be found in the large lot
		on Mayfield Avenue closest to Braun (and Tresidder Student Union).
		There is no parking enforcement after 4 p.m. on weekdays. You may
		park for free in any pay or permit slot (except for disabled slots)
		for rehearsal.
