		<h2 id="joining">Joining the Chorus</h2>
		<p>The Stanford Symphonic Chorus is open to all students, faculty, staff and any other residents of the community interested in singing wonderful music.</p>
		<p>Members who are not students or faculty pay a modest (currently $60) participation fee. This money helps to offset expenses, the largest of which is hiring orchestras.</p>

		<h3 id="auditions">Auditions</h3>
		<p>
			New members are normally accepted by audition at the beginning of each academic quarter.
			If you are interested in auditioning for the chorus for the fall quarter of 2016, please email
			<script type="text/javascript">
				unScramble("erictuan", "stanford.educator", "Eric Tuan", "Regarding auditions");
			</script>
			<noscript>Eric Tuan at: erictuan/AT/stanford/DOT/-e-d-u-/</noscript>.
		</p>

		<p>Auditions take about ten minutes, are very "user-friendly," and consist of:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Vocalizing (singing scale passages, or similar) with piano support to determine range.</li>
			<li>Pitch memory exercises (we'll play three or four notes in sequence on the piano, and you sing them back).</li>
			<li>Picking pitches out of a chord texture (we play three pitches simultaneously on the piano, and ask you to sing the highest, middle, or lowest pitch).</li>
			<li>Simple sight singing</li>
			<li>30 seconds to a minute of a prepared song. This can be anything that you enjoy singing: art song, aria, musical theatre number, jazz tune, hymn tune, children's song, or the ever popular choices of: first verse of <em>My country 'tis of thee</em>, <em>Amazing Grace</em>, <em>Edelweiss</em>, etc.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>NB: Due to facilities restrictions, the Symphonic Chorus is capped at a <em><strong>maximum of 220 members</strong></em>. For potential new members wishing to join the ensemble, please understand that members who have made the full year-long commitment in previous seasons have first priority. New members will be accepted as space allows, with voice part and section balances taken into account.</p>

			<!-- PUT UP 9/22  TWO OF TWO THIS PAGE
We'll have sign-up sheets with specific audition times, based on Jim's availability, at the first two rehearsals. Those will probably be scheduled for: after the 9/23 rehearsal; before and after the 9/30 rehearsal; and in the evening on 10/1.

END 9/22 TWO OF TWO NOTICES -->
			<h2 id="c3">Expectations</h2>

			<h3 id="c4">Learning the Music</h3>
			<p>Each singer is expected to learn the music assigned for each
				rehearsal on his or her own. Beyond the first reading of a work,
				rehearsal time will be devoted to the development of ensemble
				sound, interpretation, and other musical matters. It is further
				expected that each singer will make a reasonable effort to develop
				his or her own vocal skills, and will make every effort to
				contribute in a positive manner to the work of the group.</p>
			<h3 id="c5">Concert Dress</h3>
			<p>
				Men wear tuxedos or a tuxedo-like suits (i.e., black; not grey,
				brown or blue), white shirt, black bow tie, black shoes and socks.
				Women wear all black: long dress, or long black skirt or slacks
				with long-sleeved (preferably) or short-sleeved black blouse, and
				black shoes. Please <strong>no sleeveless tops</strong> and <strong>no
					flashy jewelry.</strong>
			</p>
			<h3 id="c6">Covering Your Music</h3>
			<p>
				For performances music must be put in a black folder or notebook,
				or bound with a black cover. Don't wait until the last minute to
				find a cover which will be practical in performance! (See <a
					href="#folders">Music Folders</a> on this page for resources.)
			</p>

			<h3 id="Aroma">
				<a href="nofragrance.html">Fragrance-Free Policy</a>
			</h3>
			<p>
				Several people in the chorus are particularly sensitive to scented
				products such as perfume and hair spray; all of us have to sing in
				close quarters and benefit by having air to breathe which is as
				pure as possible. On all rehearsal days, and especially on dress
				rehearsal and performance days, we request you do not use any such
				products. For further information, including information on
				obtaining scent-free alternatives, see <a href="nofragrance.html">extensive
					guidelines.</a>
			</p>

			<a id="Schedule"></a>
			<h2 id="c7">Rehearsals</h2>
			<p>Rehearsals are held Monday evenings from 7:30 to 10:00 in Campbell Recital Hall in the Braun Music Building, but please be <em>early</em> for the first rehearsal, since it will take extra time to get everyone signed up and to distribute the music, which will be available at the rehearsal. Sign ups start at <strong>6:30 p.m.</strong></p>

			<p>In addition, there are optional but warmly encouraged
				sectional rehearsals on selected Wednesday evenings from 5:30 to
				6:30. Just before the performance we typically have two
				&ldquo;dress rehearsals,&rdquo; also mandatory, when we rehearse
				with the orchestra, usually in the hall in which we will be
				performing. Concert dress is not required or even recommended at
				these rehearsals. Other rehearsals are typically accompanied by
				piano only.</p>

			<p>Members may miss up to two required rehearsals during the
				quarter. Members who miss more than two required rehearsals without
				prior arrangement with the director will not be allowed to
				participate in the performance. You must notify the director in
				advance if for any reason you must miss all or part of a rehearsal.
				For those participating for graded credit, every two unexcused
				absences may result in the lowering of the final grade by one
				letter.</p>

			<h3>Music</h3>
			<p>
				The music to be performed is always available at the first two
				rehearsals.
				<!-- It can also be purchased at the Stanford Bookstore
				on the Stanford Campus, downstairs in the textbook section under
				Music 162. -->
			</p>

			<h3>Parking</h3>
			<p>Parking for rehearsals can usually be found in the large lot
				on Mayfield Avenue closest to Braun (and Tresidder Student Union).
				There is no parking enforcement after 4 p.m. on weekdays. You may
				park for free in any pay or permit slot (except for disabled slots)
				for rehearsal.</p>
