{{!--
    Render the citation of a piece of music. This partial template assumes that the piece data contains at least
    a title field, and zero or more additional fields. Declared in YAML with the following fields:

        # title of the piece
        title: "Symphony No. 9"

        # title can also be an array of strings when a given piece is performed as a set or medley.
        # The composite piece is rendered with each segment decorated as its own piece (e.g. italicized)
        # with each segement joined as a proper English list (e.g. A, B, and C)
        title:
        -   "NÃ¤nie"
        -   "Schicksalslied"

        # (optional) name of the composer
        composer: "Beethoven"

        # The family name of the composer is inferred (e.g. for sorting purposes) from the last word of the
        # composer's name. If that is not desired, the composer's name can be specified as an array of name segments.
        # When done in this way, the composer's name will be displayed by joining each segment with spaces, and
        # the last element of the array will be used as the composer's family name.
        composer: ["Ralph", "Vaughan Williams"]

        # (optional) name of the movement from a major piece (when performing only one movement)
        movement: "Ode to Joy"

        # (optional) when pieces are named in a foreign language, citations might include a translation of the name
        translaton: "Requiem"

        # (optional) some pieces will have a commonly known name in addition to their formal name
        commonTitle: "Pastorale"

        # (optional) some pieces will be commonly cited with a catalog reference
        catalog: "Op. 65"

        # (optional) some pieces will be an arrangement for which the arranger should be cited
        arranger: "Elgar"

    Given such data, the piece will be cited like this general formula:

        <em>{movement}</em> from
        <em>{title[0]}</em>, {title[1]}, ..., and <em>{title[N]}</em>
        ({translation})
        "{commonTitle}"
        , {catalog}
        , arranged by {arranger}
