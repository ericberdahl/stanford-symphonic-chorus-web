    For an equally successful, though quite different experience, Bryden
    Thomson's recording (Chandos CHAN 8764) is a winner. Compelling and
    evocative, Thomson conducs a more expansive performance than Boult. Still,
    this is a reading that is never lacking in energy and excitement whwere
    needed. The London Symphony Orchestra and Chorus are in top form, and the
    choral singing is cleaner and more polished than in either of Boults's
    recordings. Baritone soloist Brian Rayner Cook is outstanding, with the
    right combination of heft and lyricism. Sonically, this is the finest of all
    available recordings â€” warm, rich, with exquisite detail and an almost
    uncanny depth to the soundstage. The opening of the first movement in this
    recording is truly audiophile demonstration stuff!
