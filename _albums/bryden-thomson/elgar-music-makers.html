    The late Bryden Thomson recorded <em>The Music Makers</em> for the Chandos
    label in 1992, and it is far and away the most sonically arresting recording
    of the work (Chandos CHAN 9022). There is  tremendous detail and
    wide-ranging timbral color coupled here with a sense of atmosphere and space
    around the performers that is a bit lacking in the other two versions
    currently available. Thomson’s tempi are well-judged and there is a sense of
    energy and verve that is unique to this recording. However, though the
    large-scale shapes work well, there is not the same kind of attention to
    detail in intimate gestures as one hears in Davis’ reading—and Elgar’s score
    is full of indications for such gestures. The London Philharmonic Chorus’
    singing is polished and energetic, and the ensemble is cleaner and more
    cohesive than in Boult’s version—though still not up to the standard of
    Davis’. Linda Finnie’s mezzo lacks some of the sweetness of Dame Janet
    Baker, but there is a creamy thickness to the voice that is very alluring in
    the bigger sections.
