    Colin Davis' recording is available as part of a 2 CD set (Philips 438 362-2) 
    with the <em>Missa solemnis</em> at a 2 for 1 price.  
    Definitely a great way to expand your Beethoven choral music 
    collection.  The performance is conservatively paced, but even the 
    tempi that are slower than Shaw's have a forward momentum that give 
    direction and dramatic presence to the music.
    The London Symphony Chorus' performance is mostly first-rate, both 
    technically and musically, with all sections well up to the task.  Only 
    in the Crucifixus, does the blend get rough.  Warm, vintage Philips 
    analog sound has been retained nicely on the CD.
