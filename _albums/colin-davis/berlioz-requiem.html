    Colin Davis's reading has long been regarded as one of the strongest available
    (Philips 415 283-2, coupled with Berlioz' <em>Symphonie fun&egrave;bre et triomphale,</em> op. 15).
    Davis directs the combined forces of the London Syphony Chorus, the John Alldis Choir, and the Wandsword School Boy's Choir (it was Davis' idea to add the boy's choir, not Berlioz') in a performance filled with passion and depth. 
    The grand scale of the work is enhanced by the surprisingly intimate sounding pianissimos contrasted with the most glorious of fortissimos.
    The orchestral planing is superb in tone and the 1969 recording has the characteristically warm, vintage Philips analog sound that has been well transferred to CD.
    There are only two factors that detract from making this recording the clear top recommendation. 
    Though recorded in the vast acoustic of Westminster Cathedral (London's Roman Catholic Cathedral), 
    the sound is suprisingly lacking in atmosphere.
    Alan Smythe attributes this partly to the building's unfinished brick interior surfaces, 
    though the close miking of the performers is a major contributing factor as well.
    The miking points up the recording's other weaknesses&mdash;the tone of the tenors in high-register,
    forte dynamic sections. The miking is in fact so close that individual voices in the tenors can be heard.
    Some of those voices are not very pretty singing up there above the staff (!).
    This is particularly problematic in the <em>Dies irae</em>, <em>Rex tremendae</em>, and <em>Lacrymosa</em>.
    Still, even with these minor caveats, this recording provides the listener with an extremely
    statisfying and musically uplifting experience.
