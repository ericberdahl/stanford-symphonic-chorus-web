<p>
    Frieder Bernius conducting the Kammerchor Stuttgart with the Deutsche
    Kammerphilharmonie (Carus 83.202) is taut and lean with bright tempi.
    Textures are very cleanly etched, and there is terrific flow and forward
    momentum to the phrasing. The orchestral introduction to the first Allegro
    (m. 88) is immaculately playedâ€”stunning!
