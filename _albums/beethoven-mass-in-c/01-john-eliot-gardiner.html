    John Eliot Gardiner's reading (Archiv 435 391-2) is an easy first 
    choice.
    Both the singing and the orchestral playing are top-notch.  The 
    Monteverdi Choir sings with flawless choral blend, precision in diction 
    and intonation, and convincing phrasing&mdash;a joy to listen to.  The 
    Orchestre Revolutionaire et Romantique, utilizing period instruments, 
    plays with equal precision, and a vast palette of tonal color.  No thin 
    sounding strings or shrill winds here&mdash;just first-rank playing 
    with an almost fiendish energy.  The soloists are well up to the 
    standards set by the choir and orchestra.  The voices are a bit larger 
    and more full-bodied than in many "period" instrument recordings, and 
    the color suits the music perfectly.  Be advised that the orchestra 
    tunes to A=415 rather than the contemporary standard of A=440 so you 
    won't be able to play this recording and play your part along on your 
    piano when you study.
