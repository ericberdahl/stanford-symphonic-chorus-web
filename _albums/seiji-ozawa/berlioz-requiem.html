    Ozawa and French repertoire is often a rewarding match, and his 1994 recording of the <em>Messe des morts</em> 
    is no exception (RCA 09026-62544-2). The playing of the Boston Symphony Orchestra is beautiful as ever, 
    but it is the Tanglewood Festival Chorus that really makes this disc a pleasure to listen to. Clear, precise, 
    unified and committed singing are the hallmarks of this performance. The tone of the tenors in the upper registers is approropriately sweet or powerful as needed, without any hint of over-singing or edginess that detracts from other recordings. Diction, vowel color, entrances and cutoffs are delivered completely as one voice&mdash;such a pleasure to hear! Vinson Cole's contribution as tenor soloist is passionate and delivered with each phrase musically shaped, even though his intonation is not always spot-on.
