    If you choose to own only one recording, Ozawa's most recent version (Philips 422 363-
    2) is a winner. Every aspect of the performance is exuberant and energized, colorful and
    alive. The Shinyukai Choir sings flawlessly—there is consummate precision in pitch,
    diction, blend and musical shaping and direction of phrase—and yet, this is a
    performance that has no hint of being over-controlled. Appropriately, the affect is fresh
    and youthful. One should note that the choir sings this performance from memory, and
    the resulting tightness of ensemble (all eyes are on the conductor all the time!) is
    stunning. The soloists are all top-notch, with Thomas Hampson's abbot thoroughly
    arresting. Edita Gruberová sings seductively and ease and control from the depths of the
    In trutina to the soaring Dulcissime. There is also an excellent commercial video that
    was filmed live in concert close to the same time as the studio audio recording was made,
    though the video features Kathleen Battle as soprano soloist rather than Gruberová.
    Sonics are excellent with a fairly close presence, though good spatial perspective is
    maintained.
