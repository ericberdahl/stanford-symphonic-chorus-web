<p>
    James Levine has the advantage of having Pavarotti as his tenor soloist fo rhte <em>Sanctus,</em> 
    and Luciano sounds as ravishing as one would expect (Deutsche Grammophon 429 724-2). 
    The Berlin Philharmonic is sterling in presentation, 
    but alas, the Ernst-Senff Choir is not up to snuff.
    <em>Penguin</em> cites the raggedness of some of hte choral entries as being problematic,
    and the unity of tone is definitely no tin the same class as the Atlanta ensemble.
