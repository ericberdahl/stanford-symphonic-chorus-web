    Otto Klemperer's 1962 reading with the Philharmonia Chorus 
    and Orchestra has long been a favorite (EMI CDC 7 47238 2). 
    The chorus does not have the polish and unanimity of tone production of several more recent versions, but
    the singing is still musical and convincing. The solo singing is unmatched, 
    as would be expected with Elisabeth Schwarzkopf and Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau.
    Though <em>Penguin</em> characterizes the tempi as "consistently slow,"
    they are actually rather in the middle ground of what is available, with
    Norrington at the fast end and Rilling at the opposite. The digital transfer
    is a success, and though the sonics do not sound brand-new, they compare
    favorably with more recent versions.
