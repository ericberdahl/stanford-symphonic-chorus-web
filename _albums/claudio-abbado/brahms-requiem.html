    Of the "big-band" versions available, Claudio Abbado's newest with the Berlin
    Philharmonic and the Swedish Radio Chorus and Eric Ericson Chamber Choir
    (Deutsche Grammophon 437 517-2) is a winner.  
    Taken from live concerts, there are the expected minor glitches: 
    audience coughs, occasional end-of-word consonants
    that are not perfectly lined up, etc.  
    But the overall impact and beauty of the playing and singing is top-drawer.  
    Cheryl Studer is a radiant soprano
    soloist, and Andreas Schmidt's baritone contribution is admirable for its
    warmth and depth--though the real star of the recording is still the choir.
    Through the years, the DG engineers seem increasingly better able to cope
    with the odd flatness of Berlin's Philharmonie as a recording venue, and the
    recorded sound for this release is full and rich with no lack of detail.
