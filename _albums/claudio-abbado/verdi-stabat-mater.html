    The <em>Stabat mater</em> on the YouTube recording with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47tm6mSTOgg&t=6m12s">Claudio Abbado conducting the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra</a>, and the Wiener Konzertvereinigung and soprano soloist Cheryl Studer is wonderful.
    Note, however, that this video is of all four of the <em>Sacred Pieces</em>.
    Colorful but also a more polished choral presentation than Rucardo Muti's.
    As with Muti, Abbado's tempi are expansive â€” some might argue (not me!) almost to a fault, but the music-making is so convincing that there are never any lapses in direction, tension, and overwhelming musicality.
