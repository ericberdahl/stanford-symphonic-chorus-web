<p>
    Among recordings that include this quarter's repertoire as fill-ups, 
    Abbado's version of N&auml;nie is warm and expansive (Deutsche Grammophon 435 349-2).  
    The main work on the disc is a great performance of Brahms' 4th Symphony, 
    and one also gets Brahms' Haydn Variations as a bonus.  
    The Rundfunkchor Berlin sings with a winning blend of emotion and technical precision.  
    The recorded sound is forward and brilliant but with no lack of warmth&mdash;though 
    with a strong sense of "podium perspective" as opposed to "back-in-the-house perspective."
