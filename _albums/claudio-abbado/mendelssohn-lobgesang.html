    Claudio Abbado conducting the London Symphony Orchestra and Chorus with soloists Elizabeth Connell and Karita Mattila (sopranos) and Hans Peter Blochwitz (tenor). Expansive and grand in conception. Excellent choral singingâ€”the intimacy and reverence of the a cappella chorale "Nun danket alle Gott" is stunning. It is part of a 4-CD box set of all 5 Mendelssohn symphonies plus 7 overtures. All available at mid-price on Deutsche Gramophon (471 467-2).
    The entire set is terrific.
