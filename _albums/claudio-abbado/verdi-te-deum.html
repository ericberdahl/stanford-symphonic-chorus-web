<p>
    Verdi's <em>Te Deum</em> is well-served on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47tm6mSTOgg&t=25m26s">YouTube</a> with a recording with Claudio Abbado conducting the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra, and the Wiener Konzertvereinigung and soprano soloist Cheryl Studer.
    Note, however, that this video is of all four of the <em>Sacred Pieces</em>, and the <em>Te Deum</em> starts at 25:26.
