<p>
    To hear my tempi and phrasing for Finziâ€™s God is gone up, there is a performance by the Stanford
    Chamber Chorale form winter term 2008 available on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84mrFdSJZi0">YouTube channel</a>, though with organ
    accompaniment rather than orchestra.
