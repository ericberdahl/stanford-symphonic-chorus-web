    Lighter-weight, intimate, and currently out of print, is George 
    Guest's performance with the St. John's College Choir, Cambridge 
    (last in print as London 430 361-2). The pleasing clarity of the boys' 
    voices allow for well-delineated textures, and though the grand 
    moments are sometimes lost due to the intimacy of the forces, this is a 
    lovely performance to own if you can find it.
