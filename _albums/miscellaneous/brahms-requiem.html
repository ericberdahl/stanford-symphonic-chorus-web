    There are many other highly recommended recordings, and the listener really
    can't go wrong with any of several versions.  
    Sinopoli's red-blooded reading with the Prague Philharmonic Chorus and the Czech Philharmonic is dramatic and well recorded (Deutsche Grammophon 429 486-2).  
    Either of Karajan's later two versions (EMI CDM 7 69229-2 from 1977 or Deutsche Grammophon 431 651-2 from the early 1908's) is good.  
    And although both feature the Vienna Singverein, the choir seems in better voice on the earlier EMI version.  
    Haitink conducts a very persuasive performance (Philips 432 038-2)
    with the Vienna State Opera Chorus and the Vienna Philharmonic.  Tempi are
    very slow and <em>Penguin</em> praises the "rapt quality in this glowing
    performance."
