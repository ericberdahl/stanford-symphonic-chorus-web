    Herbert Blomstedt's recording with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra and Chorus is
    a strong contender in a crowded field (London 430 509-2). As Penguin puts it, the scope
    is "grand" and "opulent," and all the performers seem to be "enjoying themselves
    hugely." The spirit and vigor of the performance lay to rest any preconceptions of
    Blomstedt as an intellectual if somewhat detached conductor. All this is especially
    pleasing, given that the contract situation for this recording was close to "we'll do a
    Nielsen cycle with you and your orchestra if you record a digital Carmina for us."
    Happily, there is imagination and verve in this performance, and Blomstedt emphasizes
    to great effect, the contrasts of color, affect, and dynamic. The trio of soloists are
    uniformly strong, and the childrens choruses are excellent. An enthusiastic
    recommendation for the local team!
