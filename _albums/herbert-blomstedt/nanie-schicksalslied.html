<p>
    There are four excellent recordings that contain both N&auml;nie and Schiscksalslied on a single disc. 
    Herbert Blomstedt's performance with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra and Chorus 
    also includes the Alto Rhapsody (Jard van Nes, mezzo), Begr&auml;bnisgesang, 
    and Gesang der Parzen (London 430 281-2).
    Sterling singing and playing are hallmarks of this disc, one of the SFS's best ever.  
    The chorus sings with passion, warmth, precision, excellent blend, and a dynamic feel for declamation of text.
    There is more attention to the architecture of phrase in this recording 
    than on any other&mdash;both on micro and macro levels.  
    This is emotional, colorful, seductive, and engaging Brahms&mdash;outstanding!
