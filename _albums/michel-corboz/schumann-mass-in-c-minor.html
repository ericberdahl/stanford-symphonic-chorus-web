    Michel Corboz’s 1988 release with the Choeur et Orchestre de
    la foundation Gulbenkian de Lisbonne (WEA Apex Classics ECD75542)
    is a strong contender recorded just after Sawallisch’s
    recording. The studio recording seems to allow for a greater
    control over balances, especially that of soloists vs. everyone
    else. A slightly cleaner and leaner performance, Corboz
    doesn’t have the weighty impact of Sawallisch, but textures
    are more etched and well-defined. The choral singing is clean in
    both tone and execution, with convincing drama in the Credo. The
    pairing with Schumann’s <em>Requiem für Mignon</em>
    makes for an attractive package.
