<p>
    German conductor Klaus Tennstedt passed away in 1998 – a year in which the Stanford Symphonic Chorus 
    last performed Brahms' Schiscksalslied – 
    and his recording is a wonderful testament to his compelling musical vision.  
    This Schiscksalslied is used as filler in a two-CD set 
    (for the price of one: EMI 7243 5 69518 2 2) with Brahms' 4th Symphony (Jochum conducting) 
    and Ein deutsches Requiem (Tennstedt conducting, with the fabulous Jessye Norman and Jorma Hynninen as soloists). 
    The choral tone of the BBC Symphony Chorus is bright&mdash;sometimes on the edge of disconcertingly so, 
    especially in the sopranos and tenors, but the attention to phrase and dynamics 
    is convincing and dramatic&mdash;some of the hushed passages are magical.  
    Be advised that Ein deutsches Requiem is split between the two discs&mdash;not ideal, 
    but only a slight annoyance for such a terrific performance.  
    This recording is technically no longer in the EMI catalog, but can still be found on-line.
