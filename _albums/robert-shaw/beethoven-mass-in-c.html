    Robert Shaw's 1990 recording (Telarc CD-80248) is a "big-band" 
    performance with precision and beauty of tone in both the singing and 
    playing, and more expansive tempi than Gardiner. The deliberate tempo 
    of the Gloria (it runs two-ahd-a-half minutes longer than Gardiner) is 
    weighty and grand as opposed to light and exuberant. But, as always 
    with Shaw, there is great beauty in the performance, including 
    wonderful contributions by all the soloists.  The sound is typical 
    Telarc, clean, round, no brittleness, but with the chorus set a little 
    further back in a rather gauzy acoustic.
