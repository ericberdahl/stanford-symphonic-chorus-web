    Robert Shaw's 1981 recording (Telarc CD-80056) arguably boasts the most polished
    choral singing among current releases. The Atlanta Symphony Chorus sing with
    consistent energy and poise, though with a more homogenized and uniform (and
    somewhat less characterful) presentation throughout than their English rivals above. The
    team of soloists is consistently strong, though recorded somewhat flatly and unnaturally
    closely relative to the chorus and orchestra. Soprano Judith Blegen suffers the least from
    this unkind treatment while baritone HÃ¥ken Hagegard does not fare as well. Tenor
    William Brown displays more control, especially in the register changes, than Gerald
    English does on Previn's recording. The Atlanta Boy Choir holds its own against any of
    its European rivals and in fact, display more sensitivity to ensemble than do Previn's
    boys. Shaw's tempos are lively though there is not the rhythmic flair and flexibility that
    Ozawa and Burgos display. Unfortunately, the CD is divided into only four tracks (each
    track is indexed by separate section within the larger movements) so that searching for
    specific sections can become somewhat tedious. The liner notes offer a new scholarly
    translation of the text prepared by Jeffrey Dubin of the Goethe Institute in Atlanta at
    Shaw's request.
