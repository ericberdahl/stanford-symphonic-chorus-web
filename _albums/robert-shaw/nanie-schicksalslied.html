<p>
    Robert Shaw's recording of Nänie and Schiscksalslied is also coupled with the Alto Rhapsody 
    (Marilyn Horne, mezzo–wow!), and Gesang der Parzen (Telarc CD-801760).  
    Clean, well-shaped, and with all the polish that one expects from Shaw's work.  
    An excellent choice that offers a great Alto Rhapsody as part of the package.  
    The only caveat is the recorded sound of the chorus, which is set somewhat distantly 
    in the sound stage relative to the other recordings on this list.
