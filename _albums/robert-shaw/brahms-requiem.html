    Robert Shaw recorded the <em>Requiem</em> in 1984 for Telarc (Telarc CD-80092)
    as part of his traversal of the great choral/orchestral masterworks for that
    label.  Both singing and playing are excellent, and tempi are generally even
    more expansive than Klemperer's--though there is still the tautness and 
    precision necessary to bring off the work's more complex contrapuntal sections.
    Arleen Aug&eacute;r is pure and poised as soprano soloist.  The only minor quibble
    with this offereing is that the chorus is placed quite far back in the recorded
    perspective, detracting from the listener's perception of the ensemble's
    lyric diction.
