    Peter Neumann’s performance with the Kölner Kammerchor
    and organ accompaniment by Christoph Anselm Noll instead of
    orchestra (MDG Gold MDG3320598) has an appealing intimacy that
    allows textures to emerge without forcing or overstatement. The
    choral singing is top notch, as are the soloists. The pairing with
    rarely heard works by Brahms (<em>Missa Canonica Sanctus</em> and <em>Agnus
    Dei,</em> <em>Kyrie in G minor,</em> <em>Fugue for Organ in A-flat
    major</em>) makes this something of a novelty as well.
