    Matthew Best and his Corydon Singers and Orchestra present one of the most satisfying 
    of the contemporary recordings available (though even this recording is now 20 years old!: 
    Helios CDH55332, or you may be able to find used versions on the Hyperion label CDA66599).  
    Jean Rigby is arresting in the mezzo-soprano solos, and tenor John Mark Ainsley sings 
    with a dramatic range of color and heft.  The Corydon Singers, as always, 
    are perfect in ensemble, intonation, blend when needed (the <em>piannisimo</em> passages are breathtaking), 
    and vibrant, fruity color when the music demands it.
