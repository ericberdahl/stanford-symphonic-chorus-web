    If it's clean you want, it's clean you get with Matthew Best conducting the
    Corydon Singers and Orchestra (Hyperion CDA66599). This is British Cathedral
    choir perfection (though a mixed choir of all mature voices) delivering a
    controlled but never staid performance. Wonderful choral tone, exacting
    attention to detail in diction and ensemble, and the best recorded sound of
    the three Bruckner CDs on this list.
