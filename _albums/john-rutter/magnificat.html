    Although the last time the Stanford Symphonic Chorus performed John Rutter’s <em>Magnificat</em> was in
    2002, the best reference recording is still the same one as it was then: the composer’s performance
    with the Cambridge Singers and the City of London Sinfonia. It’s available on 
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3E536C109CC5106F">YouTube</a>.
    Each movement is a separate clip, and there is the convenient, scrolling vocal score that
    accompanies the music.

    If you still like to buy CDs, it’s odd that this version is currently out of print in the Collegium catalog
    (John Rutter’s home record label). But, it’s still available via amazon.com though from 3rd party
    vendors. One can find it in either (i) the original 1993 packaging (Collegium COLCD 114), which
    also includes The Falcon, along with two festival anthems, O praise the Lord of heaven, and Behold the
    tabernacle of God (ii) or the more recent 2011 compilation with his ever-popular Requiem (Collegium
    CSCD 504). The choral singing is first-rate (much of the choir being made up of alums of the Choir
    of Claire College, Cambridge from when Rutter was an undergrad there). And with the composer
    conducting, one presumes that the tempi and pacing are exactly as he intended.
