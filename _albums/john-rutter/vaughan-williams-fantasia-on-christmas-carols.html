<p>
    John Rutter&rsquo;s excellent version with the Cambridge Singers
    and the City of London Sinfonia presents the version for full orchestra
    (Colleguium CSCD 512).
    Baritone soloist Stephen Varcoe is lighter than Allen,
    and though the acoustic is rich and resonant,
    it is less misty than the version at King&rsquo;s,
    allowing the textures of the orchestration to be revealed
    with compelling clarity.
