<p>
    John Rutter&rsquo;s <em>Blow, Blow Thou Winter Wind</em> and <em>Good Ale</em>
    both come from the suite <em>When Icicles Hang</em>
    and are available with the composer conducting on the CD
    titled &ldquo;Fancies&rdquo; (Collegium CSCD 516).
    The presentation is enjoyably lightweight
    (as are the pieces!),
    though the singing never lacks in precision, verve,
    and impeccable tonal cohesion.
