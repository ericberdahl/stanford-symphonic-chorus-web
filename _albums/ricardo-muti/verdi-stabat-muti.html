    A colorful, romantic, almost over-wrought (but hey, can performances of this piece ever really be over-wrought?!) performance of Verdi’s <em>Stabat mater</em> can be found on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv1yQFQnsds&t=59s">YouTube</a>.
    Conducted by Ricardo Muti, and featuring the Chorus and Orchestra of Teatro alla Scala, Milan, tempi are gloriously expansive and phrase-shaping is broadly-conceived and on a grand scale.
    The playing and singing are equally rich in color — this is not a chorus in which pure, blended tone production is a goal in the same way it is in, say, the Anglican Cathedral tradition!
    But what a compelling and inviting performance that’s full of drama, angst, and some of the most beautifully rich <em>dolce</em> singing among on-line performances.
