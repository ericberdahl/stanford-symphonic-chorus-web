    Sir Adrian Boult’s famous 1966 recording is generously coupled with the
    grandest of Elgar’s large-scale choral works, The Dream of Gerontius in a
    2-CD set at mid-price (EMI 7243 5 66540 2 0), or
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJGDOrZ-_6Y">online at YouTube</a>.
    Dame Janet baker is the mezzo soprano soloist, and her obbligato over the
    Nimrod material from Elgar’s earlier Enigma Variations is truly stunning—on
    no other recording is this solo given such a profoundly musical and
    emotional reading. While the London Philharmonic Chorus sings with energy,
    there is some lack of tonal cohesiveness, especially in the tenors and
    basses when singing forte above the staff. And though the chorus is perhaps
    not as engaging as on other recordings, it is Boult’s complete and utterly
    convincing command of shape and direction of phrase that makes this
    recording an excellent choice. The London Philharmonic Orchestra plays with
    a real connection to this music and the sound is vintage EMI analog—warm
    with pleasing balances.
