    For the strongest recordins in the catalog, one would logically turn to
    conductors from the UK, and in this instance the results are most pleasing.
    Sir Adrian Boult recorded this work twice, once in 1954 and again in 1968,
    both times with the London Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir. A champion of
    Vaughan Williams' music, Boult premiered RVW's third, fourth, and sixth
    sympohnies. His later recording of <em>A Sea Symphony</em> (EMI CDM 64016 2)
    is still one of the finest available. There is always a keen sense of
    large-scale shape and direction, and tempi are never overly sentimental.
    Both chorus and orchestra are excellent (except for the first exclamation of
    the word "sea" that doesn't quite tune will into the chord), as are the
    soloists Sheila Armstrong and John Carol Case. Particularaly lovely are the
    extended duet passages in the last movement. Though the sound is somewhat
    close, the overall effect is clean and powerful. Boult's earlier mono
    recording (London 425 658-2) is a wonderful reference point--the composer
    was present at the recording sessions. A young, and, perhaps, "hotter"
    reading.
