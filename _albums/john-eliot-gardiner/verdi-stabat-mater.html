    In a completely different direction is John Eliot Gardiner's performance of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRxIv6zlRTs">Te Deum</a> with the Orchestre Révolutionnaire et Romantique and the Monteverdi Choir.
    The tempi are brisk — although closer to the tempo indications that Verdi himself preferred.
    And, there is a verve and trajectory that is mightily convincing here. Choral singing and orchestral playing are superbly polished — probably more so than any other commercial recording available.
    A very different experience than Ricardo Muti and Claudio Abbado, but definitely worth a listen!
