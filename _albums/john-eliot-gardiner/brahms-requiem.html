    Stunning it its clarity, tautness, drama, polished playing and singing, and
    overwhelming musicality is John Eliot Gardner's 1990 recording with the
    Monteverdi Choir and the Orchestre R&eacute;volutionnaire et Romantique
    (Philips 432 140-2). One of two currently available versions using period
    instruments, textures are cleanly etched and highlighted. The 
    lighter tone of gut-strung violins, short Viennese oboes, and small, bright
    timpani played with hard sticks rather than soft, fuzzy mallets, contribute
    to the clarity. Still, there is no lack of weight and strength here.
    The Choir, augmented for this recording to a total of 48 members, sings 
    impeccably. Perfect diction, intonation, phrasing, and a wonderfully
    varied tonal palette are always hallmarks of the ensemble&mdash;and are in
    evidence here as much as ever.  
    Gardiner's unwavering attention to Brahms' scrupulous dynamic and phrasing markings is admirable, and the results point up the composer's architectural genius.  
    Glowing singing by soloists
    Rod Gilfry and Charlotte Margiono round out this first-rate recommendation.
    By comparison, the other "period instrument" version, conducted by
    Roger Norrington (EMI CDC 7 54658 2), is a disappointment.  Though clean
    and tight, with some beautiful singing and playing, it is noticeably lacking
    in drama and impact&mdash;the results are more "Brahms-Lite-ish"&mdash;like a Bach
    cantata on steriods.
