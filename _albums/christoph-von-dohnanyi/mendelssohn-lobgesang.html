    Christoph von Dohnányi conducting the Vienna Philharmonic with the Vienna Singverein. Sonia Ghazarian and Edita Gruberova, sopranos and Werner Krenn, tenor. More taut than Abbado's reading. The choral singing is in the typical Vienna Singverein style&mdash;dramatic, colorful, and rich in tone if not always as polished in ensemble and cohesion as the LSO Chorus (above). Part of a budget-priced 2-CD set that also includes the Mendelssohn's 1st Symphony and his cantata "Die erste Walpurgisnacht." London/Decca 289 460 236-2.
