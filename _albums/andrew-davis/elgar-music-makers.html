    Perhaps the strongest performance in every aspect is Andrew Davis’ 1994
    recording with the BBC Symphony Orchestra and Chorus and Jean Rigby, mezzo
    soloist. This is also the most recent release of this work (Teldec 92374,
    and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSrGT0vNPdY">online at
    YouTube</a>). There is more minute detail in shaping of phrase in this
    performance than any of the other available versions—yet, this does not come
    at the expense of a grand and sweeping grasp of large-scale architecture. 
    The chorus sings with great precision, excellent diction, a colorful tonal
    palette, and stunning control of dynamics. Jean Rigby combines a warmth or
    timbre similar to Dame Janet Baker’s—with just enough edge where the text
    requires it. This would be a strong first recommendation, except for the
    fact that the entire piece is one long, 39’47” track—there are no track
    divisions between sections! Very inconvenient. Of course, you could dub this
    down to a duplicate CD or Mini Disc and add your own track divisions for
    study purposes . . .
