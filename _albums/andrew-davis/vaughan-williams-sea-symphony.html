    Fans of baritone Thomas Hampson can hear him on Teldec's offering (Teldec
    4509-94550-2) conducted by Andrew Davis. With this recording the BBC
    Symphony Chorus and Orchestra, the third of the "Big Three" London choir and
    orchestra combinations, are given their chance to shine. With tempi that are
    slightly more brisk, this reading is full of energy and verve. One curious
    point is the recording itself that sounds at the same time close and
    somewhat woolly&mdash;perhaps made more apparent if one listens to this
    recording immediately following the previous Chandos disc.
