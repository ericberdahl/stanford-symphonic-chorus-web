<p>
    Among his conducting students, it is often said that "[Helmut] Rilling is thrilling" – and 
    this is readily apparent in his recording of both Nänie and Schicksalslied 
    with the Gächinger Kantorei Stuttgart and Bach-Collegium Stuttgart (Hänssler Classic CD 98.122).  
    These are burnished, glowing, expansively molded performances with sensuous choral singing 
    and sterling orchestral playing (the opening soprano entrance in Nänie is to die for!).  
    Also on the disc are Brahms' Gesang der Parzen and Vier Gesänge für Frauenchor.  
    Highly recommended, though a little less convenient to obtain as it often needs to be imported from Europe.
