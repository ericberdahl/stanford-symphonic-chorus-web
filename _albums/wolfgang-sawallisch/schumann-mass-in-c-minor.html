    One of the strongest performances available is Wolfgang
    Sawallisch’s live recording from 1987 with the Chor des
    Stadtischen Musikverein zu D&uuml;sseldorf and the Berlin
    Philharmoniker (EMI CDC7 49763-2). The romantic sweep of
    Schumann’s writing is brought to the fore by Sawallisch:
    dynamics are wide ranging, rubato is free, and the color of the
    vocal production is rich and fruity. The soloists (Mitsuko Shirai,
    soprano; Peter Seiffert, tenor; Jan-Hendrik Rootering, bass) are
    strong both individually and as a team, and Shirai’s reading
    of the Offertory (here with organ and solo <em>obbligato</em>
    ‘cello), is eloquent, glowing, and appropriately intimate. In her
    performance it serves much the same function at the apex of the
    work’s musical trajectory as <em>Ihr hapt nun
        Traurigkeit</em> does in Brahms’s <em>Ein deutsches Requiem.</em>
    The only complaint regarding this recording is that the soloists
    are rather closely-placed in the sound stage relative to all the
    other forces. On this CD, the Mass is coupled with SchumannÆs
    <em>Requiem,</em> another lovely and under-performed work.
