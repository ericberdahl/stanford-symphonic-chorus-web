    Wonderfully successful (as would be expected!) is Helmuth Rilling conducting
    the Gächinger Kantorei Stuttgart and the Bach-Collegium Stuttgart (Hänssler
    98.119, coupled with Bruckner's Mass No. 2 in e minor and the Te Deum). The
    soprano tone can be a bit "screamy" above the staff when singing at big
    volumes (almost unavoidable when singing sustained high Bb above full
    orchestra!), but the drama is winning—there's a reason we say "Rilling is
    thrilling"! And nobody controls those tutti luftpause like Maestro Rilling.
