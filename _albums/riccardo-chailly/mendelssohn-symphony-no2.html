    Riccardo Chailly conducting the London Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir. Margaret Price and Sally Burgess, sopranos. Siegfried Jerusalem, tenor. Refined, with no lack of strength when needed. In the a cappella passages, the choral tone suffers some from lack of unity. The organ is more present than in either of the above recordings. Part of a budget-priced 2-CD set that also includes Mendelssohn's 1st &amp; 3rd symphonies as well as the Hebrides Overture. Philips 456 071-2.
