    Sir Thomas Beecham's 1959 recording has long been a yardstick of 
    measurement for performances of this work, and is available in a 
    budget-priced 2-CD set coupled with Beethoven's 2nd and 7th Symphonies 
    CD (EMI 0724358650426).  The Beecham Choral Society's singing is 
    definitely '50's vintage.  Their performance is colorful and meaty, if 
    somewhat lacking in the precision and perfect blend of Gardiner's 
    forces.  The team of soloists is evenly matched, and more operatic 
    sounding than Gardiner's quartet.  The performance has wonderful energy 
    and pacing, with tempi almost as crisp as Gardiner's.  The sonics are 
    good, if slightly edgy and brittle by contemporary standards.
