<p>
    Richard Hickox's dramatic account (EMI 5099996893425,
    also downloadable from amazon.com) features the London Symphony Chorus
    and Orchestra, the Choristers of St. Paul Cathedral, 
    and soloists Elizabeth Gale, Robert Tear, and Stephen Roberts.
    Hickox's tempi are lively, and the chorus sings with tremendous vigor
    and a wonderful range of color and emotion.
    Ensemble is mostly excellent, though there are occasional lapses
    at phrase endings&mdash;particularly in softer passages.
