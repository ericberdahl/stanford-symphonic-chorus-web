    Since its release, André Previn's 1975 reading on (EMI CDC 7 47411 2) has always remained
    at or near the top of the recommended list. Though not always the cutting edge in
    precision, in variety of choral tone color and energetic presentation, the London
    Symphony Orchestra Chorus is unmatched. The tenors' Ecce gratum, while not the most
    beautiful, is indeed the "blaze of color" that the text proclaims. Sheila Armstrong's
    soprano is beguiling and inviting. Her In trutina is understated and ravishing, and her
    Dulcissime is honey-toned, open and easy all the way to the high D. Baritone Thomas
    Allen is at his best in this recording, his Abbot's song arrestingly dramatic and his
    Estuans interius characteristically dark and burning. Only tenor Gerald English's
    roasting swan song is uncomfortable—but then how would you feel if you were a bird
    being roasted for dinner? The boy's choir from St. Clement Danes Grammar School
    lends a colorful and earthy contribution to the proceedings - not at all the typical English
    boy's choir sound. This recording is a wonderful example of an older analog recording
    that sonically outshines much of its more contemporary all digital competition. The
    sound is brilliant but not hard, spatial characteristics are excellent with front to back
    imaging quite wonderful, and the spotlighting of orchestral soloists from the ranks of the
    London Symphony Orchestra is handled in a most subtle and tasteful manner. 25
    separate tracks on the CD make for easy navigation in this highly sectionalized piece.
    Previn also has a new version recorded in 1994 (Deutsche Grammophon 439 950-2)
    which I have not yet had the opportunity to audition.
