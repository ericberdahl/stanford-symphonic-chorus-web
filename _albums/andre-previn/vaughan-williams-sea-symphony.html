<p>
    A young André Previn conducts a young RVW on RCA's recording (RCA
    60580-2-RG). Lojng a strong recommendation in the catalog, this performance
    retains its freshness almost thirty years after it was recorded. Again, the
    London Symphony Orchestra and Chorus give an idiomatically spirited and
    colorful performance. Heather Harper and John Shirley-Quirk are simple and
    tender in their last movement pairing.
