    Rafael Frühbeck de Burgos presents a rhythmically vital performance—perhaps the most
    "live" sounding (spontaneity-wise) of all the studio recordings currently available. This
    1965 recording (EMI CDM 7 69060 2) was produced in conjunction with London performances
    which utilized the exact same forces at the same time. The New Philharmonia
    Chorus sing with an uncanny rhythmic assuredness, accommodating Burgos' flexible
    tempi without any hint of constraining the conductor from carrying out his wishes. Lucia
    Popp is an especially sweet-timbred soprano, and the tenor, Gerhard Unger brings what
    Penguin characterizes as "Lieder-like sensitivity" to his tavern scene solo. Baritone duty
    is handled admirably by Raymond Wolansky except for the Dies, nox et omnia which is
    stylishly sung by John Noble. The Wandsworth School Boy's Choir sing beautifully, although
    they sound a bit out of place—something like an Anglican cathedral choir transplanted
    to bawdy 13th century Bavaria. As Penguin notes, the CD remastering is not entirely
    successful, with a hard, glassy edge to the sound not at all evident in the excellent
    vintage LP (Angel 36333, if you enjoy hunting the used record stores).
