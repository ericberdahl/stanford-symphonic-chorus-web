    Gerd Albrecht conducts the Danish National Choir/DR and Danish National Symphony Orchestra 
    in a disc that includes both Nänie and Shicksalslied as well as Brahms' Triumphlied 
    and Ave Maria (Chandos CHAN 10165).  
    The performances are breathtakingly clean, and ensemble execution is precise–but oddly, 
    Nänie feels slower than the 13:22 timing would indicate, 
    and Schicksalslied definitely feels lighter and less weighty than the other recordings on this list 
    (e.g., 14:52 compared with Blomstedt's reading that clocks in at 17:11).  
    Stunning Chandos sound, as one would expect.
