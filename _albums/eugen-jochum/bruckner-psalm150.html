    One of the classic recordings of Bruckner's Psalm 150 is Eugen Jochum
    conducting the Chor der Deutschen Oper Belin and the Berlin Philharmoniker
    (Deutsche Grammophon 457 743-2, mid-priced and coupled with the Te Deum and
    a generous selection of Bruckner's a cappella motets). The choral singing is
    vintage; rich, full-throated, colorful—and often without a real sense of
    "blend" (neither vowel, vibrato, or timbre). In fact, in some of the softer
    passages, the competing vibratos rather obscure the pitch. But, this is
    still a wonderful performance—passionate and committed. Recorded in 1965,
    the sound also vintage DG: warm and detailed analog with a terrific sense
    of space and depth.
