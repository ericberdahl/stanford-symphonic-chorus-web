<p>
    I grew up with LPs of Eugen Jochum's recordings of Bruckner's Masses 
    from the 1960's and early 1970's—recordings that are still available 
    re-mastered on CD or by digital download (DG 0289 447 4092 9).  
    The performance of the F minor <em>Mass</em> is still as taught and glowing as ever, 
    with a wonderful arc to the pacing—especially through the big <em>Gloria</em> and <em>Credo</em> compound movements.  
    Though the sound is rather on the compressed side when compared to contemporary recordings, 
    the reading is well worth having as a cornerstone to your Bruckner choral library.
