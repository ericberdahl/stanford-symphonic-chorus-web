    There is a fine performance
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EixX7n3QAjg">online at YouTube</a>
    that was recorded live at The Proms, with the BBC Orchestra and Chorus
    conducted by Leonard Slatkin, with mezzo-soprano soloist Lorraine Hunt
    Lieberson. In addition to the excitement of being a live performance at The
    Proms, there is wonderful cohesiveness in the romantic sweep â€” Slatkin
    controls arc and shape of phrase with wonderfully engaging drama. The BBC
    Chorus sings with polish and dynamism, and of course, Lorraine Hunt
    Lieberson is a stunning soloist. Highly recommended!
