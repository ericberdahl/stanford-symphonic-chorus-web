    For unbridled energy and visceral excitement, Bernstein's 1975 performance with the orchestre 
    Nationale de France and the French Radio/TV Chorus is unmatched (Sony M2YK 46461 or Sony SM2K 47526).
    The ascending chromatic scales in the <em>Dies irae</em> feel as if they are electrically charged,
    and the waves of sound in the <em>Lacrymosa</em> are urgent and unceasing. 
    Drama is the touchtone of this performance, and the recording is close and dramatic
    to match without sacrificing any of the ambience of the venue.
