    More recently, Robert Shaw has recorded the <em>Requiem</em> with his Atlanta forces (Telarc CD-80109, coupled with Bo&iuml;to's <em>Prolog to Mefistolfele</em> and Verdi's <em>Te Deum</em>). 
    Though a more straightforward, and perhaps less emotionally charged reading than Davis', Shaws' Atlanta Symphony Chorus is the ultimate in polish and percision.
    All sections sing with unfailing unity of tone and vowel, pitch is dead-center, and diction is immaculate.
    John Aler is the radiant, almost angelic tenor, and he floats effortlessly above the chorus in the <em>sanctus</em>.
    The orchestral playing is well up to standard though th esound o fthe instrumentalists seems oddly as if it were in a different acoustic than the choir.
    Where Davis' choir sounds too up-front, Shaw's seems recessed and even a bit cloudy in recorded sound compared to the orchestra.
    The strengths and weaknesses of the Davis and Shaw recordings are in complimentrary distribution, and the avid collector
    will no doubt desire both of them.
