    A fine 2005 performance of the Magnificat performed by the Choir of King’s College, Cambridge and
    the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Stephen Cleobury is available on EMI
    (originally on CD: EMI 7243 5 57952 2, and now available for digital download from amazon.com).
    The boy trebles of King’s College, Cambridge are typically superb, though it’s interesting to hear
    them sing with a more brilliant and forward timbre than is typical (in this case, a good tool for
    overcoming the large orchestration). And as always, Stephen Cleobury is fastidiously dedicated to
    the written score. A winning performance!
