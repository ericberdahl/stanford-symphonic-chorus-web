<p>
    David Willcocks' classic reading with the Choir of King's College,
    Cambridge, and the soloist Harvey Allen is still available
    on a budget priced Decca double-CD set titled
    "NoÃ«l: Christmas at King's." 
    This is the version with organ and strings rather than full orchestra,
    but the singing is King's College Choir at its best
    and the ~50-year-old recording still sounds fresh and atmospheric.
