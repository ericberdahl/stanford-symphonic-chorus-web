<p>
    David Willcocks&rsquo; classic reading with the Choir of King's College,
    Cambridge, and the soloist Harvey Allen is still available
    on a budget priced Decca double-CD set titled
    &ldquo;No&euml;el: Christmas at King&rsquo;s.&rdquo; 
    This is the version with organ and strings rather than full orchestra,
    but the singing is King&rsquo;s College Choir at its best
    and the &tilde;50-year-old recording still sounds fresh and atmospheric.
