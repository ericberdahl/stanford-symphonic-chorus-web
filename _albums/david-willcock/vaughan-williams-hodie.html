<p>
    David Willcock's famous 1966 version with the Bach Choir,
    the Guildford Cathedral Choir, and the London Symphony Orchestra
    (EMI 0724356742727, also downloadable from amazon.com)
    is still the version to have.
    The team of soloists (Janet Baker, mezzo; Richard Lewis, tenor;
    and John Shirley-Quirk, bass) is stunning.
    Though the part Baker sings was written for a soprano,
    she sings with a winning radiance and innocence that is incomparable.
    The orchestra and chorus are both stunning and the recording is vintage,
    warm EMI from the 60's&mdash;a strong argument for the attractiveness
    of fine analog recordings.
