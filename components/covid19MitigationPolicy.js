                    Since the Symphonic Chorus is also offered as a class to Stanford students, all members,
                    irrespective of whether or not they have an official affiliation with the university,
                    must meet Stanford's COVID-19 mitigation policy that states: the university no longer requires
                    - but continues to strongly recommend - COVID vaccinations and boosters.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>In a change from past practice, masks are highly recommended, but no longer required.</b> Of
                    course, participants are always welcome to remain masked if desired.
