                    Membership in the Stanford Symphonic Chorus requires proof of full vaccination for participation.
                    Masking is highly recommended but not required.
                    Those who prefer to mask are most welcome to do so.
                    These requirements may change over time with the always-shifting nature of health and safety requirements as set forth by the university.
