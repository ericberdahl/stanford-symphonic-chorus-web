            Lawrence Foster conducts the Rundfunk Sinfonieorchester und Chor Belin
            (Decca 460 211-2) and the piece is coupled with Franz Waxman's haunting Das
            Lied von Terezin. Though this setting of the 92nd Psalm was originally
            composed in English, this recording is in Hebrew, as we will perform it.
            Note also, that although the text in the score is transliterated in Hebrew
            as it would have been spoken in pre-war, Eastern Europe, we will perform the
            work in modern Hebrew - and this recording is also in modern Hebrew. The
            sweep and emotion of the performance is gripping, and the soloists (baritone
            Michael Kraus, in particular) are appropriately cantorial.
