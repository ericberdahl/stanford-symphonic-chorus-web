            Wonderfully successful (as would be expected!) is Helmuth Rilling conducting
            the Gächinger Kantorei Stuttgart and the Bach-Collegium Stuttgart (Hänssler
            98.119, coupled with Bruckner's Mass No. 2 in e minor and the Te Deum). The
            soprano tone can be a bit "screamy" above the staff when singing at big
            volumes (almost unavoidable when singing sustained high Bb above full
            orchestra!), but the drama is winning—there's a reason we say "Rilling is
            thrilling"! And nobody controls those tutti luftpause like Maestro Rilling.

            One of the classic recordings of Bruckner's Psalm 150 is Eugen Jochum
            conducting the Chor der Deutschen Oper Belin and the Berlin Philharmoniker
            (Deutsche Grammophon 457 743-2, mid-priced and coupled with the Te Deum and
            a generous selection of Bruckner's a cappella motets). The choral singing is
            vintage; rich, full-throated, colorful—and often without a real sense of
            "blend" (neither vowel, vibrato, or timbre). In fact, in some of the softer
            passages, the competing vibratos rather obscure the pitch. But, this is
            still a wonderful performance—passionate and committed. Recorded in 1965,
            the sound also vintage DG: warm and detailed analog with a terrific sense
            of space and depth.

            If it's clean you want, it's clean you get with Matthew Best conducting the
            Corydon Singers and Orchestra (Hyperion CDA66599). This is British Cathedral
            choir perfection (though a mixed choir of all mature voices) delivering a
            controlled but never staid performance. Wonderful choral tone, exacting
            attention to detail in diction and ensemble, and the best recorded sound of
            the three Bruckner CDs on this list.

    Bruckner's Psalm 150 is relative easy to find, and the piece(s) it's coupled
     with on different CDs might well determine which version you wish to
     purchase.
