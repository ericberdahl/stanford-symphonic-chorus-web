            One of the strongest performances available is Wolfgang
            Sawallisch’s live recording from 1987 with the Chor des
            Stadtischen Musikverein zu Düsseldorf and the Berlin
            Philharmoniker (EMI CDC7 49763-2). The romantic sweep of
            Schumann’s writing is brought to the fore by Sawallisch:
            dynamics are wide ranging, rubato is free, and the color of the
            vocal production is rich and fruity. The soloists (Mitsuko Shirai,
            soprano; Peter Seiffert, tenor; Jan-Hendrik Rootering, bass) are
            strong both individually and as a team, and Shirai’s reading
            of the Offertory (here with organ and solo <em>obbligato</em>
            ‘cello), is eloquent, glowing, and appropriately intimate. In her
            performance it serves much the same function at the apex of the
            work’s musical trajectory as <em>Ihr hapt nun
                Traurigkeit</em> does in Brahms’s <em>Ein deutsches Requiem.</em>
            The only complaint regarding this recording is that the soloists
            are rather closely-placed in the sound stage relative to all the
            other forces. On this CD, the Mass is coupled with SchumannÆs
            <em>Requiem,</em> another lovely and under-performed work.

            Michel Corboz’s 1988 release with the Choeur et Orchestre de
            la foundation Gulbenkian de Lisbonne (WEA Apex Classics ECD75542)
            is a strong contender recorded just after Sawallisch’s
            recording. The studio recording seems to allow for a greater
            control over balances, especially that of soloists vs. everyone
            else. A slightly cleaner and leaner performance, Corboz
            doesn’t have the weighty impact of Sawallisch, but textures
            are more etched and well-defined. The choral singing is clean in
            both tone and execution, with convincing drama in the Credo. The
            pairing with Schumann’s <em>Requiem für Mignon</em>
            makes for an attractive package.

            Peter Neumann’s performance with the Kölner Kammerchor
            and organ accompaniment by Christoph Anselm Noll instead of
            orchestra (MDG Gold MDG3320598) has an appealing intimacy that
            allows textures to emerge without forcing or overstatement. The
            choral singing is top notch, as are the soloists. The pairing with
            rarely heard works by Brahms (<em>Missa Canonica Sanctus</em> and <em>Agnus
            Dei,</em> <em>Kyrie in G minor,</em> <em>Fugue for Organ in A-flat
            major</em>) makes this something of a novelty as well.

	Schumann's <em>Mass in C minor,</em> Op. 147, certainly
	doesn't suffer from over-exposure in the catalog of available
	recordings.
