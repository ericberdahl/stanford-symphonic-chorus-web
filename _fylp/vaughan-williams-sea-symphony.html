    Happily, there are a good number of excellent recordings of all of Ralph
    Vaughan Williams symphonies. His first symphony, <em>A Sea Symphony</em>,
    was completed in 1909. A vast and majestic work of grand proportions, it is
    composed in the typical symphonic four movements and sets wonderful text by
    Walt Whitman.
