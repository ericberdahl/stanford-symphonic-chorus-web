<p>
	A wonderful embarrassment of riches faces those looking to procure a recording
	of Brahms' <em>Ein Deutsches Requeim</em> for their collection.
	This monument of Brahms' <em>oeuvre</em> has always been well represented on disc,
	and from the continuous output of outstanding versions, it looks as though the
	trend will happily continue.
