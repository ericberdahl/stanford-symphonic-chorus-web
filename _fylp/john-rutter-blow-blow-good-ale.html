        <p>
            John Rutter's <em>Blow, Blow Thou Winter Wind</em> and <em>Good Ale</em>
            both come from the suite <em>When Icicles Hang</em>
            and are available with the composer conducting on the CD
            titled "Fancies" (Collegium CSCD 516).
            The presentation is enjoyably lightweight
            (as are the pieces!),
            though the singing never lacks in precision, verve,
            and impeccable tonal cohesion.
