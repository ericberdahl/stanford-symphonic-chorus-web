		<h2 id="joining">Joining the Chorus</h2>
		<p>
			The Stanford Symphonic Chorus is open to all students, faculty,
			staff and any other residents of the community interested in singing
			wonderful music.
		</p>
		<p>
			Members who are not students or faculty pay a modest {{#if performances.current.fees.registration }}(currently
			{{ performances.current.fees.registration }}){{/if}} participation fee. This money helps
			to offset expenses, the largest of which is hiring orchestras.
		</p>

		<h3 id="auditions">Auditions</h3>
		<p>
			New members are normally accepted by audition at the beginning of
			each academic quarter.
			If you are interested in auditioning for the chorus for the
			{{ performances.current.quarter }} quarter, please email
			{{> people_citation person='administrator' subject="Regarding auditions" }}
			.
		</p>

		<p>Auditions take about ten minutes, are very "user-friendly," and consist of:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Vocalizing (singing scale passages, or similar) with piano
				support to determine range.
			</li>
			<li>
				Pitch memory exercises (we'll play three or four notes in
				sequence on the piano, and you sing them back).
			</li>
			<li>
				Picking pitches out of a chord texture (we play three pitches
				simultaneously on the piano, and ask you to sing the highest,
				middle, or lowest pitch).
			</li>
			<li>Simple sight singing</li>
			<li>
				30 seconds to a minute of a prepared song. This can be anything
				that you enjoy singing: art song, aria, musical theatre number,
				jazz tune, hymn tune, children's song, or the ever popular
				choices of: first verse of <em>My country 'tis of thee</em>,
				<em>Amazing Grace</em>, <em>Edelweiss</em>, etc.
			</li>
		</ul>
		{{#if performances.current.limits.membership }}
		<p>
			NB: Due to facilities restrictions, the Symphonic Chorus is capped
			at a <em><strong>maximum of {{ performances.current.limits.membership }} members</strong></em>.
			For potential new members wishing to join the ensemble, please
			understand that members who have made the full year-long commitment
			in previous seasons have first priority. New members will be
			accepted as space allows, with voice part and section balances taken
			into account.
		</p>

		<h2 id="c3">Expectations</h2>

		<h3 id="c4">Learning the Music</h3>
		<p>Each singer is expected to learn the music assigned for each
			rehearsal on his or her own. Beyond the first reading of a work,
			rehearsal time will be devoted to the development of ensemble
			sound, interpretation, and other musical matters. It is further
			expected that each singer will make a reasonable effort to develop
			his or her own vocal skills, and will make every effort to
			contribute in a positive manner to the work of the group.</p>
		<h3 id="c5">Concert Dress</h3>
		<p>
			Men wear tuxedos or a tuxedo-like suits (i.e., black; not grey,
			brown or blue), white shirt, black bow tie, black shoes and socks.
			Women wear all black: long dress, or long black skirt or slacks
			with long-sleeved (preferably) or short-sleeved black blouse, and
			black shoes. Please <strong>no sleeveless tops</strong> and <strong>no
				flashy jewelry.</strong>
		</p>
		
		<h3 id="c6">Covering Your Music</h3>
		<p>
			For performances music must be put in a black folder or notebook, or bound with a black cover.
			Don't wait until the last minute to find a cover which will be practical in performance! (See <a href="#folders">Music Folders</a> on this page for resources.)
		</p>

		<h3 id="Aroma">
			<a href="/nofragrance.html">Fragrance-Free Policy</a>
		</h3>
		<p>
			Several people in the chorus are particularly sensitive to scented
			products such as perfume and hair spray; all of us have to sing in
			close quarters and benefit by having air to breathe which is as
			pure as possible. On all rehearsal days, and especially on dress
			rehearsal and performance days, we request you do not use any such
			products. For further information, including information on
			obtaining scent-free alternatives, see
			<a href="/nofragrance.html">extensive guidelines.</a>
		</p>

		<a id="Schedule"></a>
		<h2 id="c7">Rehearsals</h2>
		<p>
			Rehearsals are held Monday evenings from 7:30 to 10:00 in Campbell
			Recital Hall in the Braun Music Building, but please be <em>early</em>
			for the first rehearsal, since it will take extra time to get
			everyone signed up and to distribute the music, which will be
			available at the rehearsal. Sign ups start at <strong>6:30 p.m.</strong>
		</p>

		<p>
			In addition, there are optional but warmly encouraged
			sectional rehearsals on selected Wednesday evenings from 5:30 to
			6:30. Just before the performance we typically have two
			"dress rehearsals," also mandatory, when we rehearse
			with the orchestra, usually in the hall in which we will be
			performing. Concert dress is not required or even recommended at
			these rehearsals. Other rehearsals are typically accompanied by
			piano only.
		</p>

		<p>
			Members may miss up to two required rehearsals during the
			quarter. Members who miss more than two required rehearsals without
			prior arrangement with the director will not be allowed to
			participate in the performance. You must notify the director in
			advance if for any reason you must miss all or part of a rehearsal.
			For those participating for graded credit, every two unexcused
			absences may result in the lowering of the final grade by one
			letter.
		</p>

		<h3>Music</h3>
		<p>The music to be performed is always available at the first three rehearsals.</p>

		<h3>Parking</h3>
		<p>
			Parking for rehearsals can usually be found in the large lot
			on Mayfield Avenue closest to Braun (and Tresidder Student Union).
			There is no parking enforcement after 4 p.m. on weekdays. You may
			park for free in any pay or permit slot (except for disabled slots)
			for rehearsal.
