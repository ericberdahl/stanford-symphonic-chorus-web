    description: |
        To hear my tempi and phrasing for Finziâ€™s God is gone up, there is a performance by the Stanford
        Chamber Chorale form winter term 2008 available on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84mrFdSJZi0),
        though with organ accompaniment rather than orchestra.
