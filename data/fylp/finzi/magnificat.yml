        For a version of Finzi's _Magnificat_ with orchestra accompaniment, there is a fine 1978
        performance with Richard Hickox conducting the City of London Sinfonia, and believe it or not, an
        unidentified choir on Decca (468 807-2). The performance is part of a 2-CD set that includes
        several of Finzi’s larger-scale works including his In terra pax, Dies natalis, For St Cecilia, Romance for
        string orchestra, and the song cycles Earth and air and rain, and Let us garlands bring. Again, it’s out of
        print, but there are 3rd party vendors that still have it available via amazon.com.
