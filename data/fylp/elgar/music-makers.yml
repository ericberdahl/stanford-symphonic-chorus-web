        Elgar’s <em>The Music Makers</em> is well represented in the current catalog
        of recordings and online, despite the fact that it is very rarely performed
        here in the U.S. There are three readily available recordings, and all can
        be strongly recommended.

            Sir Adrian Boult’s famous 1966 recording is generously coupled with the
            grandest of Elgar’s large-scale choral works, The Dream of Gerontius in a
            2-CD set at mid-price (EMI 7243 5 66540 2 0), or
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJGDOrZ-_6Y">online at YouTube</a>.
            Dame Janet baker is the mezzo soprano soloist, and her obbligato over the
            Nimrod material from Elgar’s earlier Enigma Variations is truly stunning—on
            no other recording is this solo given such a profoundly musical and
            emotional reading. While the London Philharmonic Chorus sings with energy,
            there is some lack of tonal cohesiveness, especially in the tenors and
            basses when singing forte above the staff. And though the chorus is perhaps
            not as engaging as on other recordings, it is Boult’s complete and utterly
            convincing command of shape and direction of phrase that makes this
            recording an excellent choice. The London Philharmonic Orchestra plays with
            a real connection to this music and the sound is vintage EMI analog—warm
            with pleasing balances.

            Perhaps the strongest performance in every aspect is Andrew Davis’ 1994
            recording with the BBC Symphony Orchestra and Chorus and Jean Rigby, mezzo
            soloist. This is also the most recent release of this work (Teldec 92374,
            and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSrGT0vNPdY">online at
            YouTube</a>). There is more minute detail in shaping of phrase in this
            performance than any of the other available versions—yet, this does not come
            at the expense of a grand and sweeping grasp of large-scale architecture. 
            The chorus sings with great precision, excellent diction, a colorful tonal
            palette, and stunning control of dynamics. Jean Rigby combines a warmth or
            timbre similar to Dame Janet Baker’s—with just enough edge where the text
            requires it. This would be a strong first recommendation, except for the
            fact that the entire piece is one long, 39’47” track—there are no track
            divisions between sections! Very inconvenient. Of course, you could dub this
            down to a duplicate CD or Mini Disc and add your own track divisions for
            study purposes . . .

            The late Bryden Thomson recorded <em>The Music Makers</em> for the Chandos
            label in 1992, and it is far and away the most sonically arresting recording
            of the work (Chandos CHAN 9022). There is  tremendous detail and
            wide-ranging timbral color coupled here with a sense of atmosphere and space
            around the performers that is a bit lacking in the other two versions
            currently available. Thomson’s tempi are well-judged and there is a sense of
            energy and verve that is unique to this recording. However, though the
            large-scale shapes work well, there is not the same kind of attention to
            detail in intimate gestures as one hears in Davis’ reading—and Elgar’s score
            is full of indications for such gestures. The London Philharmonic Chorus’
            singing is polished and energetic, and the ensemble is cleaner and more
            cohesive than in Boult’s version—though still not up to the standard of
            Davis’. Linda Finnie’s mezzo lacks some of the sweetness of Dame Janet
            Baker, but there is a creamy thickness to the voice that is very alluring in
            the bigger sections.

            There is a fine performance
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EixX7n3QAjg">online at YouTube</a>
            that was recorded live at The Proms, with the BBC Orchestra and Chorus
            conducted by Leonard Slatkin, with mezzo-soprano soloist Lorraine Hunt
            Lieberson. In addition to the excitement of being a live performance at The
            Proms, there is wonderful cohesiveness in the romantic sweep — Slatkin
            controls arc and shape of phrase with wonderfully engaging drama. The BBC
            Chorus sings with polish and dynamism, and of course, Lorraine Hunt
            Lieberson is a stunning soloist. Highly recommended!
