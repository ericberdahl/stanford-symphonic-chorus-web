piece:
    composer: "Edward Elgar"
    title: "The Music Makers"

description: |
    Elgar’s _The Music Makers_ is well represented in the current catalog
    of recordings and online, despite the fact that it is very rarely performed
    here in the U.S. There are three readily available recordings, and all can
    be strongly recommended.

albums:
-   director: "Adrian Boult"
    label: "EMI 7243 5 66540 2 0"

        Sir Adrian Boult’s famous 1966 recording is generously coupled with the
        grandest of Elgar’s large-scale choral works, The Dream of Gerontius in a
        2-CD set at mid-price (EMI 7243 5 66540 2 0), or
        [online at YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJGDOrZ-_6Y).
        Dame Janet baker is the mezzo soprano soloist, and her obbligato over the
        Nimrod material from Elgar’s earlier Enigma Variations is truly stunning—on
        no other recording is this solo given such a profoundly musical and
        emotional reading. While the London Philharmonic Chorus sings with energy,
        there is some lack of tonal cohesiveness, especially in the tenors and
        basses when singing forte above the staff. And though the chorus is perhaps
        not as engaging as on other recordings, it is Boult’s complete and utterly
        convincing command of shape and direction of phrase that makes this
        recording an excellent choice. The London Philharmonic Orchestra plays with
        a real connection to this music and the sound is vintage EMI analog—warm
        with pleasing balances.

-   director: "Andrew Davis"
    label: "Teldec 92374"

        Perhaps the strongest performance in every aspect is Andrew Davis’ 1994
        recording with the BBC Symphony Orchestra and Chorus and Jean Rigby, mezzo
        soloist. This is also the most recent release of this work (Teldec 92374,
        and [online at YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSrGT0vNPdY)). There is more minute detail in shaping of phrase in this
        performance than any of the other available versions—yet, this does not come
        at the expense of a grand and sweeping grasp of large-scale architecture. 
        The chorus sings with great precision, excellent diction, a colorful tonal
        palette, and stunning control of dynamics. Jean Rigby combines a warmth or
        timbre similar to Dame Janet Baker’s—with just enough edge where the text
        requires it. This would be a strong first recommendation, except for the
        fact that the entire piece is one long, 39’47” track—there are no track
        divisions between sections! Very inconvenient. Of course, you could dub this
        down to a duplicate CD or Mini Disc and add your own track divisions for
        study purposes . . .

-   director: "Bryden Thomson"
    label: "Chandos CHAN 9022"

        The late Bryden Thomson recorded _The Music Makers_ for the Chandos
        label in 1992, and it is far and away the most sonically arresting recording
        of the work (Chandos CHAN 9022). There is  tremendous detail and
        wide-ranging timbral color coupled here with a sense of atmosphere and space
        around the performers that is a bit lacking in the other two versions
        currently available. Thomson’s tempi are well-judged and there is a sense of
        energy and verve that is unique to this recording. However, though the
        large-scale shapes work well, there is not the same kind of attention to
        detail in intimate gestures as one hears in Davis’ reading—and Elgar’s score
        is full of indications for such gestures. The London Philharmonic Chorus’
        singing is polished and energetic, and the ensemble is cleaner and more
        cohesive than in Boult’s version—though still not up to the standard of
        Davis’. Linda Finnie’s mezzo lacks some of the sweetness of Dame Janet
        Baker, but there is a creamy thickness to the voice that is very alluring in
        the bigger sections.

-   director: "Leonard Slatkin"

        There is a fine performance
        [online at YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EixX7n3QAjg)
        that was recorded live at The Proms, with the BBC Orchestra and Chorus
        conducted by Leonard Slatkin, with mezzo-soprano soloist Lorraine Hunt
        Lieberson. In addition to the excitement of being a live performance at The
        Proms, there is wonderful cohesiveness in the romantic sweep — Slatkin
        controls arc and shape of phrase with wonderfully engaging drama. The BBC
        Chorus sings with polish and dynamism, and of course, Lorraine Hunt
        Lieberson is a stunning soloist. Highly recommended!
