    description:
        An iconic performance of Mascagni's _Easter Hymn_ from his opera _Cavalleria Rusticana_
        can be found in the famous [1954 recording from the Teatro alla Scala, Milan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agaMf-flMQ4&t=25m45s)
        with Tullio Serafin conducting the Chorus and Orchestra of the La Scala Opera.
        This is 1950's recording technology and a rather raw, but realistic opera chorus
        recording — wow, listen to those competing _vibrati_ in the soprano sections!
        But it gives you an honest perspective of how the piece fits into the larger context of the opera.
        Also, note that true to the original score, the organ takes that which in our performance will be covered by the winds of the orchestra.
        Also, Maria Callas sings the part of Santuzza — how wonderful is that?!
