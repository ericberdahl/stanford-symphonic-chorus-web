    There are several wonderful recordings of Berlioz's mighty _Requiem_ currently available.

albums:
-   director: Colin Davis
    label: Philips 415 283-2

        Colin Davis's reading has long been regarded as one of the strongest available
        (Philips 415 283-2, coupled with Berlioz' _Symphonie funèbre et triomphale,_ op. 15).
        Davis directs the combined forces of the London Syphony Chorus, the John Alldis Choir,
        and the Wandsword School Boy's Choir (it was Davis' idea to add the boy's choir, not Berlioz') in a performance filled with passion and depth. 
        The grand scale of the work is enhanced by the surprisingly intimate sounding pianissimos contrasted with the most glorious of fortissimos.
        The orchestral planing is superb in tone and the 1969 recording has the characteristically warm,
        vintage Philips analog sound that has been well transferred to CD.
        There are only two factors that detract from making this recording the clear top recommendation. 
        Though recorded in the vast acoustic of Westminster Cathedral (London's Roman Catholic Cathedral), 
        the sound is suprisingly lacking in atmosphere.
        Alan Smythe attributes this partly to the building's unfinished brick interior surfaces, 
        though the close miking of the performers is a major contributing factor as well.
        The miking points up the recording's other weaknesses—the tone of the tenors in high-register,
        forte dynamic sections. The miking is in fact so close that individual voices in the tenors can be heard.
        Some of those voices are not very pretty singing up there above the staff (!).
        This is particularly problematic in the _Dies irae_, _Rex tremendae_, and _Lacrymosa_.
        Still, even with these minor caveats, this recording provides the listener with an extremely
        statisfying and musically uplifting experience.

-   director: Robert Shaw
    label: Telarc CD-80109

        More recently, Robert Shaw has recorded the _Requiem_ with his Atlanta forces
        (Telarc CD-80109, coupled with Boïto's _Prolog to Mefistolfele_ and Verdi's _Te Deum_). 
        Though a more straightforward, and perhaps less emotionally charged reading than Davis',
        Shaws' Atlanta Symphony Chorus is the ultimate in polish and percision.
        All sections sing with unfailing unity of tone and vowel, pitch is dead-center, and diction is immaculate.
        John Aler is the radiant, almost angelic tenor, and he floats effortlessly above the chorus in the _sanctus_.
        The orchestral playing is well up to standard though th esound o fthe instrumentalists seems oddly as if it were in a different acoustic than the choir.
        Where Davis' choir sounds too up-front, Shaw's seems recessed and even a bit cloudy in recorded sound compared to the orchestra.
        The strengths and weaknesses of the Davis and Shaw recordings are in complimentrary distribution, and the avid collector
        will no doubt desire both of them.

-   director: Leonard Bernstein
    label: Sony M2YK 46461 or Sony SM2K 47526

        For unbridled energy and visceral excitement, Bernstein's 1975 performance with the orchestre 
        Nationale de France and the French Radio/TV Chorus is unmatched (Sony M2YK 46461 or Sony SM2K 47526).
        The ascending chromatic scales in the _Dies irae_ feel as if they are electrically charged,
        and the waves of sound in the _Lacrymosa_ are urgent and unceasing. 
        Drama is the touchtone of this performance, and the recording is close and dramatic
        to match without sacrificing any of the ambience of the venue.

-   director: James Levine
    label: Deutsche Grammophon 429 724-2

        James Levine has the advantage of having Pavarotti as his tenor soloist fo rhte _Sanctus,_ 
        and Luciano sounds as ravishing as one would expect (Deutsche Grammophon 429 724-2). 
        The Berlin Philharmonic is sterling in presentation, 
        but alas, the Ernst-Senff Choir is not up to snuff.
        _Penguin_ cites the raggedness of some of hte choral entries as being problematic,
        and the unity of tone is definitely no tin the same class as the Atlanta ensemble.

-   director: Seiji Ozawa
    label: RCA 09026-62544-2

        Ozawa and French repertoire is often a rewarding match, and his 1994 recording of the _Messe des morts_ 
        is no exception (RCA 09026-62544-2). The playing of the Boston Symphony Orchestra is beautiful as ever, 
        but it is the Tanglewood Festival Chorus that really makes this disc a pleasure to listen to. Clear, precise, 
        unified and committed singing are the hallmarks of this performance. The tone of the tenors in the upper
        registers is approropriately sweet or powerful as needed, without any hint of over-singing or edginess
        that detracts from other recordings. Diction, vowel color, entrances and cutoffs are delivered completely
        as one voice—such a pleasure to hear! Vinson Cole's contribution as tenor soloist is passionate and
        delivered with each phrase musically shaped, even though his intonation is not always spot-on.
