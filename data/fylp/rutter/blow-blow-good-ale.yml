    description: |
        John Rutter's _Blow, Blow Thou Winter Wind_ and _Good Ale_
        both come from the suite _When Icicles Hang_
        and are available with the composer conducting on the CD
        titled "Fancies" (Collegium CSCD 516).
        The presentation is enjoyably lightweight
        (as are the pieces!),
        though the singing never lacks in precision, verve,
        and impeccable tonal cohesion.
