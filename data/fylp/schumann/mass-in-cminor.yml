    Schumann's _Mass in C minor,_ Op. 147, certainly
    doesn't suffer from over-exposure in the catalog of available
    recordings.

        One of the strongest performances available is Wolfgang
        Sawallisch’s live recording from 1987 with the Chor des
        Stadtischen Musikverein zu Düsseldorf and the Berlin
        Philharmoniker (EMI CDC7 49763-2). The romantic sweep of
        Schumann’s writing is brought to the fore by Sawallisch:
        dynamics are wide ranging, rubato is free, and the color of the
        vocal production is rich and fruity. The soloists (Mitsuko Shirai,
        soprano; Peter Seiffert, tenor; Jan-Hendrik Rootering, bass) are
        strong both individually and as a team, and Shirai’s reading
        of the Offertory (here with organ and solo _obbligato_
        ‘cello), is eloquent, glowing, and appropriately intimate. In her
        performance it serves much the same function at the apex of the
        work’s musical trajectory as _Ihr hapt nun Traurigkeit_ does
        in Brahms’s _Ein deutsches Requiem._
        The only complaint regarding this recording is that the soloists
        are rather closely-placed in the sound stage relative to all the
        other forces. On this CD, the Mass is coupled with SchumannÆs
        _Requiem,_ another lovely and under-performed work.

        Michel Corboz’s 1988 release with the Choeur et Orchestre de
        la foundation Gulbenkian de Lisbonne (WEA Apex Classics ECD75542)
        is a strong contender recorded just after Sawallisch’s
        recording. The studio recording seems to allow for a greater
        control over balances, especially that of soloists vs. everyone
        else. A slightly cleaner and leaner performance, Corboz
        doesn’t have the weighty impact of Sawallisch, but textures
        are more etched and well-defined. The choral singing is clean in
        both tone and execution, with convincing drama in the Credo. The
        pairing with Schumann’s _Requiem für Mignon_
        makes for an attractive package.

        Peter Neumann’s performance with the Kölner Kammerchor
        and organ accompaniment by Christoph Anselm Noll instead of
        orchestra (MDG Gold MDG3320598) has an appealing intimacy that
        allows textures to emerge without forcing or overstatement. The
        choral singing is top notch, as are the soloists. The pairing with
        rarely heard works by Brahms (_Missa Canonica Sanctus_ and _Agnus
        Dei,_ _Kyrie in G minor,_ _Fugue for Organ in A-flat
        major_) makes this something of a novelty as well.
