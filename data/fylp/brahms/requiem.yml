    A wonderful embarrassment of riches faces those looking to procure a recording
    of Brahms' _Ein Deutsches Requeim_ for their collection.
    This monument of Brahms' _oeuvre_ has always been well represented on disc,
    and from the continuous output of outstanding versions, it looks as though the
    trend will happily continue.

        Stunning it its clarity, tautness, drama, polished playing and singing, and
        overwhelming musicality is John Eliot Gardner's 1990 recording with the
        Monteverdi Choir and the Orchestre Révolutionnaire et Romantique
        (Philips 432 140-2). One of two currently available versions using period
        instruments, textures are cleanly etched and highlighted. The 
        lighter tone of gut-strung violins, short Viennese oboes, and small, bright
        timpani played with hard sticks rather than soft, fuzzy mallets, contribute
        to the clarity. Still, there is no lack of weight and strength here.
        The Choir, augmented for this recording to a total of 48 members, sings 
        impeccably. Perfect diction, intonation, phrasing, and a wonderfully
        varied tonal palette are always hallmarks of the ensemble—and are in
        evidence here as much as ever.  
        Gardiner's unwavering attention to Brahms' scrupulous dynamic and phrasing markings is admirable, and the results point up the composer's architectural genius.  
        Glowing singing by soloists
        Rod Gilfry and Charlotte Margiono round out this first-rate recommendation.
        By comparison, the other "period instrument" version, conducted by
        Roger Norrington (EMI CDC 7 54658 2), is a disappointment.  Though clean
        and tight, with some beautiful singing and playing, it is noticeably lacking
        in drama and impact—the results are more "Brahms-Lite-ish"—like a Bach
        cantata on steriods.

-   director: Claudio Abbado

        Of the "big-band" versions available, Claudio Abbado's newest with the Berlin
        Philharmonic and the Swedish Radio Chorus and Eric Ericson Chamber Choir
        (Deutsche Grammophon 437 517-2) is a winner.  
        Taken from live concerts, there are the expected minor glitches: 
        audience coughs, occasional end-of-word consonants
        that are not perfectly lined up, etc.  
        But the overall impact and beauty of the playing and singing is top-drawer.  
        Cheryl Studer is a radiant soprano
        soloist, and Andreas Schmidt's baritone contribution is admirable for its
        warmth and depth--though the real star of the recording is still the choir.
        Through the years, the DG engineers seem increasingly better able to cope
        with the odd flatness of Berlin's Philharmonie as a recording venue, and the
        recorded sound for this release is full and rich with no lack of detail.

-   director: Otto Klemperer
    label: EMI CDC 7 47238 2

        Otto Klemperer's 1962 reading with the Philharmonia Chorus 
        and Orchestra has long been a favorite (EMI CDC 7 47238 2). 
        The chorus does not have the polish and unanimity of tone production of several more recent versions, but
        the singing is still musical and convincing. The solo singing is unmatched, 
        as would be expected with Elisabeth Schwarzkopf and Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau.
        Though _Penguin_ characterizes the tempi as "consistently slow,"
        they are actually rather in the middle ground of what is available, with
        Norrington at the fast end and Rilling at the opposite. The digital transfer
        is a success, and though the sonics do not sound brand-new, they compare
        favorably with more recent versions.

-   director: Robert Shaw

        Robert Shaw recorded the _Requiem_ in 1984 for Telarc (Telarc CD-80092)
        as part of his traversal of the great choral/orchestral masterworks for that
        label.  Both singing and playing are excellent, and tempi are generally even
        more expansive than Klemperer's--though there is still the tautness and 
        precision necessary to bring off the work's more complex contrapuntal sections.
        Arleen Augér is pure and poised as soprano soloist.  The only minor quibble
        with this offereing is that the chorus is placed quite far back in the recorded
        perspective, detracting from the listener's perception of the ensemble's
        lyric diction.

-   director: "Other recordings"

        There are many other highly recommended recordings, and the listener really
        can't go wrong with any of several versions.  
        Sinopoli's red-blooded reading with the Prague Philharmonic Chorus and the Czech Philharmonic is dramatic and well recorded (Deutsche Grammophon 429 486-2).  
        Either of Karajan's later two versions (EMI CDM 7 69229-2 from 1977 or Deutsche Grammophon 431 651-2 from the early 1908's) is good.  
        And although both feature the Vienna Singverein, the choir seems in better voice on the earlier EMI version.  
        Haitink conducts a very persuasive performance (Philips 432 038-2)
        with the Vienna State Opera Chorus and the Vienna Philharmonic.  Tempi are
        very slow and _Penguin_ praises the "rapt quality in this glowing
        performance."
