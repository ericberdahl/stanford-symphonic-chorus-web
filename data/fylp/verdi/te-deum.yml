        Verdi's _Te Deum_ is well-served on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47tm6mSTOgg&t=25m26s)
        with a recording with Claudio Abbado conducting the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra,
        and the Wiener Konzertvereinigung and soprano soloist Cheryl Studer.
        Note, however, that this video is of all four of the _Sacred Pieces_, and the _Te Deum_ starts at 25:26.

-   director: John Eliot Gardiner

        In a completely different direction is John Eliot Gardiner's performance of the
        [Te Deum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRxIv6zlRTs)
        with the Orchestre Révolutionnaire et Romantique and the Monteverdi Choir.
        The tempi are brisk — although closer to the tempo indications that Verdi himself preferred.
        And, there is a verve and trajectory that is mightily convincing here. Choral singing and
        orchestral playing are superbly polished — probably more so than any other commercial recording available.
        A very different experience than Ricardo Muti and Claudio Abbado, but definitely worth a listen!
