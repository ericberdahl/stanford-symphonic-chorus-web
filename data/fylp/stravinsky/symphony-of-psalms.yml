        *   2nd Movement: <YouTube video="e40pD5DXvq0" />

        If you’re a collector of hard-copy CDs, the recording is still in the CBS catalog (CBS MK
        42434). The program notes are written by Stravinsky himself, and provide fascinating insight
        into the compositional process in addition to discussing many musical and aesthetic issues in the
        piece. Recorded in 1963, the performance features the CBC Orchestra and the Festival Singers
        of Toronto. As it’s conducted by the composer, this recording is a critically important
        performance document.

-   director: "George Solti"

        There is an exciting performance of this work with a scrolling score conducted by George Solti
        with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.

        Among John Eliot Gardiner’s most outstanding performances is his 2002 recording of the
        Symphony of Psalms with his Monteverdi Choir and the London Symphony orchestra. It’s
        stunning in its power, precision, clarity of texture, richness of colors and spell-binding
        musicality. This recording also has some of the most beautiful wind playing — the fugue that
        opens the second movement is arresting in its sheer beauty. On YouTube, each movement
        appears separately:
        *   1st Movement: <YouTube video="_PgtW3IS2AU" />
        *   2nd Movement: <YouTube video="ahL-BmkhklU" />
        *   3rd Movement: <YouTube video="8YddFtgrs-E" />
