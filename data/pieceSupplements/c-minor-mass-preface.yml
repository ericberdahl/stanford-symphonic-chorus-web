    *A Preface to the _C-Minor Mass_*
    
    by Alan Baker

    It is an unfortunate and rather ironic fact that what are generally considered to be Mozart's two greatest choral works –
    the _C-minor Mass_ and the _Requiem_ – were both left unfinished. In fact, with Mozart's reputation for being one who
    wrote quickly and with little effort, we in the choral world might complain of unfair treatment. After all, our opera
    neighbors don't have to put up with stuff like this. Imagine if the man had just decided to stop composing with Pamina
    and Tamino wandering around in the fire and water-what kind of ending would that have been?

    With the _Requiem_, we have to grant that Mozart had a pretty good excuse for not finishing (he died). Anyway, since
    there was money riding on its getting done, his wife went out and found somebody else to get the work across the finish
    line, meaning that while it isn't all Mozart, we at least have a complete piece. We are less fortunate with the _C-minor Mass_
    (there was no money hinging on its completion), and more justified in feeling slighted that Mozart never got around to finishing it.

    While Mozart's earlier Mass settings for Salzburg had been brief works with through-composed movements (the Archbishop apparently
    didn't go for long services), in the C-minor Mass he divided the longer tests into several distinct movements, alternating extended
    choirs (up to five and eight voices) with melodious and/or virtuosic solos and ensembles to create a cantata-like form reminiscent
    of Bach's _B-minor Mass_. As for inspiration, it seems that Mozart had sworn – be it to God, himself, his father, or someone else –
    to compose a Thanksgiving Mass if dear old dad would forgive him for marrying Constanze (Leopold apparently wasn't a big Constanze fan).
    In any event, he began work on the project in the fall and winter of 1782, and by early 1783 he had set the complete texts of the _Kyrie_
    and _Gloria_, as well as the first two parts of the _Credo_. Mozart was more or less obligated to perform the Mass during his visit to
    Salzburg in the summer and early autumn of 1783, and even though he put it off until his last day in town (I'm not making this up),
    he still only managed to add the _Sanctus_ and _Benedictus_. Although he had only an incomplete _Credo_ and no _Agnus Dei_ whatsoever,
    Mozart kept his word and put the thing on just the same. Just how he got around this during the performance we still don't really know,
    but whatever happened, this was the work's first and only performance during his lifetime (Constanze sang all the big soprano solos
    to show Leopold that he was wrong about her). After that, Mozart put the score away and never worked on it again.

    He did, however, steal some big chunks of the Mass in 1785 for a now-obscure Italian cantata 'Davide penitente', and it was in this
    form that the music of the _C-minor Mass_ became popular in the nineteenth century. Its genesis as a Mass composition was forgotten
    until the early years of the twentieth century. At that point, in looking at the sources someone realized that although both the
    _Sanctus_ and the _Hosanna in excelsis_ had been written down as four-part choral settings, their musical substance implied a
    double-choir and double-fugue, respectively. (Just why Mozart might have wanted one thing and wrote down another is kind of
    complicated- let's just take the musicologist's word on this.) Anyway, the manuscript has been lost since WWII, so these particular
    movements were "reconstructed" by H.C. Robbins Landon between 1953 and 1955, making them "intellectual property". To summarize, it's
    all Mozart's fault.
