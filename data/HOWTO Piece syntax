A piece data contains at least a title field, and may contain additional fields. The simplest piece
looks like this:

    title: "Symphony No. 9"

The title field can also be an array of strings when a given piece is performed as a set or medley.
The composite piece is rendered with each segment decorated as its own piece (e.g. italicized)
with each segement joined as a proper English list (e.g. A, B, and C)

    title:
    -   "NÃ¤nie"
    -   "Schicksalslied"

Pieces may include a field containing the name of the composer

    composer: "Beethoven"

The family name of the composer is inferred (e.g. for sorting purposes) from the last word of the
composer's name. If that is not desired, the composer's name can be specified as an array of name segments.
When done in this way, the composer's name will be displayed by joining each segment with spaces, and
the last element of the array will be used as the composer's family name.

    composer: ["Ralph", "Vaughan Williams"]

Pieces may include a field with the name of the movement from a major piece (when performing only
one movement)

    movement: "Ode to Joy"

When pieces are named in a foreign language, citations might include a translation of the name
    
    translaton: "Requiem"

Some pieces will have a commonly known name in addition to their formal name

    commonTitle: "Pastorale"

Some pieces will be commonly cited with a catalog reference

    catalog: "Op. 65"

Some pieces will be an arrangement for which the arranger should be cited

    arranger: "Elgar"

Given such data, the piece will be cited like this general formula:

    <em>{movement}</em> from
    <em>{title[0]}</em>, <em>{title[1]}</em>, ..., and <em>{title[N]}</em>
    ({translation})
    "{commonTitle}"
    , {catalog}
    , arranged by {arranger}
