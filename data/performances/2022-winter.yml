    Due to recently updated COVID-19 mitigation policies and their impact on the scheduling of in-person rehearsals
    for the first portion of winter quarter 2022, rehearsals will begin on Monday, 7 February 2022.
    The winter quarter concerts have been moved to spring quarter and these will take place in addition
    to the previously-scheduled spring quarter concerts, resulting in two pairs of concerts being presented
    in spring quarter.


#   After a long hiatus, Stanford Symphonic Chorus is pleased to return to the stage with a performance
#   of Mahler's _Symphony No. 2 "Auferstehung"_ ("Resurrection"),
#   presented in collaboration with our friends in the Stanford Symphonic Orchestra.
