Recommended Recordings of Mendelssohn's Symphony No. 2, "Lobgesang"</h3>
<p>From Steve:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are several fine recordings available of this wonderful work.  Among my favorites are:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
Claudio Abbado conducting the London Symphony Orchestra and Chorus with
soloists Elizabeth Connell and Karita Mattila (sopranos) and Hans Peter
Blochwitz (tenor).  Expansive and grand in conception.  Excellent choral
singing - the intimacy and reverence of the a cappella chorale "Nun danket
alle Gott" is stunning.  It is part of a 4-CD box set of all 5 Mendelssohn
symphonies plus 7 overtures.  All available at mid-price on Deutsche
Gramophon (471 467-2).  The entire set is terrific.</p></li>

<li><p>Christoph von Dohn?nyi conducting the Vienna Philharmonic with the
Vienna Singverein.  Sonia Ghazarian and Edita Gruberova, sopranos and
Werner Krenn, tenor.  More taut than Abbado's reading.  The choral singing
is in the typical Vienna Singverein style - dramatic, colorful, and rich
in tone if not always as polished in ensemble and cohesion as the LSO
Chorus (above).  Part of a budget-priced 2-CD set that also includes the
Mendelssohn's 1st Symphony and his cantata "Die erste Walpurgisnacht".
London/Decca 289 460 236-2.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Ricardo Chailly conducting the London Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
Margaret Price and Sally Burgess, sopranos.  Siegfried Jerusalem, tenor.
Refined, with no lack of strength when needed.  In the a cappella
passages, the choral tone suffers some from lack of unity.  The organ is
more present than in either of the above recordings.  Part of a
budget-priced 2-CD set that also includes Mendelssohn's 1st & 3rd
symphonies as well as the Hebrides Overture.  Philips 456 071-2.
</p></li>
</ul>
