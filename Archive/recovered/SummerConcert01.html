<p>
Copland, <I>Fanfare for the Common Man</I> <br />

<br />

Written in 1942 by American composer Aaron
Copland, this patriotic fanfare for brass and percussion is now a
beloved classic.

The piece pays tribute to those who fought in World War II, but it has also
become closely associated with the egalitarian ideals of the Olympic
Games.

<p>
Jennings, <I>Where the Sun Will Never Go
Down</I> 
</P>

<P>
 Joe Jennings, director of the famed SF-based men's chorus,
 Chanticleer, wrote this a cappella arrangement featuring several
 American spiritual melodies.

 From "Ain't-a That Good News" to "Swing Low, Sweet
 Chariot", the piece covers the spectrum from jubilation to sorrow,
 and back again.

<br />
Kod&aacute;ly,
<I>Budav&aacute;ri Te Deum</I> 
</P>


<P>
Hungarian composer Zoltan Kod&aacute;ly is widely recognized as one
of the greatest leaders of the early 20<SUP>th</SUP>-century cultural
revival in Hungary.
His
music is deeply influenced by the folk music of his homeland, which
gives it a unique, exotic quality.

Kod&aacute;ly's Te Deum was written in 1936 to
celebrate the 250<SUP>th</SUP> anniversary of the reconquest of Buda
from the Turks. 
The piece is wonderfully joyous and brilliant.
It features four vocal soloists in addition to the
135-voice chorus and the orchestra.
</P>

<br />
<P>
Vaughan
Williams, <I>Serenade to Music</I> 
</p>

<p>
  This piece features the orchestra with sixteen vocal soloists.
  The <I>Serenade to Music</I> was premiered at the Royal Albert Hall 
  in London on October 5, 1938.

  The performance featured some of the best-known singers of the time,
   all of whom were familiar to the composer.
  Our performance will feature sixteen talented soloists from
  around the Bay Area.
