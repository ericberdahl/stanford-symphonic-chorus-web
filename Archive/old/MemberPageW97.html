</H1></A>
The Stanford Chorus is open to all students, faculty, staff and any other
residents of the community interested in singing wonderful music. 
New members will be
auditioned prior to the first rehearsal of each quarter.
The purpose of the audition is <Em>not</Em> to weed people
out;  rather it
gives our director a chance to get to know the voices which will comprise
the Chorus.


<p>Members who are not students or faculty pay a modest (currently $25)
 participation
fee. This money helps to offset expenses, the largest of which is hiring
orchestras.

<A NAME=Rehearsals>
<H1 NAME=Rehearsals>Rehearsals
</H1></A>
Rehearsals are generaly held Monday evenings from 7:15 to 9:45 in Campbell
Recital Hall in the Braun Music Building.  
In addition there are usually some optional sectional
rehearsals on Wednesday afternoons.  Just before the
performance we typically have two
&quot;dress rehearsals&quot;, also mandatory,
	   when we rehearse with the orchestra,
usually in the hall in which we will be performing.
Concert dress is not required or even recommended at these rehearsals.
Other rehearsals are accompanied by piano only.
	
<P> Members may miss up to three mandatory 
rehearsals.  Members who miss more mandatory rehearsals without prior
arrangement with the director will not be able to participate in the 
performance.

<H2>Parking</H2>
Parking for rehearsals can usually be found in the large lot closest to
Braun (and Tresidder).

<A NAME=Performances>
<H1 NAME=Performances>Performances
</H1></A>
There are usually two performances of the quarter's program.

<P><B>Concert Dress: </B>Men wear tuxedos or a
tuxedo-like suits (i.e., black; not grey, brown or blue), black shoes and
socks. Women are all in black:  long black skirt or slacks, long-sleeved black
blouse, and black shoes.  Flashy jewelry, perfume and cologne are all to
be avoided.  Music should be put in a black folder or notebook of some
sort.

<A NAME=Expectations>
<H1 NAME=Expectationss>Expectations
</H1></A>

Each singer is expected to learn the music assigned for each rehearsal on
his or her own. Beyond the first reading of a work, rehearsal time will
be devoted to the development of ensemble sound, interpretation, and other
musical matters.  It is further expected that each singer will make a
reasonable effort to develop his or her own vocal skills, and will make
every effort to contribute in a positive manner to the work of the group.
