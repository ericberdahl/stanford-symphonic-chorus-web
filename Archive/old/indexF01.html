<h1> Stanford Symphonic Chorus </h1>
<! Might be nice to have a picture here>


The Stanford Symphonic Chorus is a group of approximately 150
students, faculty, staff and members of the community at large, 
led by music director 
<a
href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/Music/faculty.html#sano">
Stephen Sano.</a>
Students may take Chorus as a
credit course within the Music Department. 

<p>The Chorus generally gives three performances a year, one each academic
quarter.  For the past several years there has also been a Summer Chorus
which performs in late summer.
</p>
<p>
  A performance typically features a large choral work, often along
with other choral or purely instrumental pieces.  The Chorus often performs
with the
<a href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/sso/">
Stanford Symphony Orchestra.</a>
In recent years it has frequently
joined forces with the
<a href="http://www.peninsulasym.org/">Peninsula Symphony Orchestra</a>.
