Stephen Sano.</A>
Students may take Chorus as a
credit course within the Music Department. 

<P>The Chorus generally gives three performances a year, one each academic
quarter.  For the past several years there has also been a Summer Chorus
which performs in late summer.
  A performance typically features a large choral work, often along
with other choral or purely instrumental pieces.  The Chorus often performs
with the

Stanford Symphony Orchestra.</A>
In recent years it has frequently
joined forces with the
