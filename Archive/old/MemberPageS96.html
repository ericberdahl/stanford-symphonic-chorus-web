The Stanford Chorus is open to all students, faculty, staff and any other
residents of the community interested in singing wonderful music. 
New members will be
auditioned prior to the first rehearsal of each quarter.
The purpose of the audition is <Em>not</Em> to weed people
out;  rather it
gives our director a chance to get to know the voices which will comprise
the Chorus.


<p>Members who are not students or faculty pay a modest (currently $25)
 participation
fee. This money helps to offset expenses, the largest of which is hiring
orchestras.

For the summer rehearsals are on Wednesdays in <b>Braun Rehearsal Hall</b> in
the Braun Music Building at <b>7 PM</b>.  During the regular academic year
rehearsals are generaly held Monday evenings from 7:15 to 9:45 in Campbell
Recital Hall in the Braun Music Building.  
In addition there are usually some optional sectional
rehearsals on Wednesday afternoons.  Just before the
performance we have one (summer) or two (regular academic year)
"dress rehearsals", also mandatory, when we rehearse with the orchestra,
usually in the hall in which we will be performing.
Concert dress is not required or even recommended at these rehearsals.
Other rehearsals are accompanied by piano only.
	
<P> Members may miss up to three mandatory 
rehearsals.  Members who miss more mandatory rehearsals without prior
arrangement with the director will not be able to participate in the 
performance.

There are usually two performances of the quarter's program except for
summer, when there is generally just one.
<P><B>Concert Dress (summer):</B> Everyone wears white on top and black
	   from the waist down.  White means really white; not cream,
beige, eggshell, etc.  Women may wear black slacks or skirts, but
preferably to the calf or longer.  Men wear long dark ties and no jackets.
Stay away from scented products (perfume, cologne, hairspray, etc.); some
people are allergic to them.

<P><B>Concert Dress (academic year):</B>Men wear tuxedos or a
tuxedo-like suits (i.e., black; not grey, brown or blue), black shoes and
socks. Women are all in black:  long black skirt or slacks, long-sleeved black
blouse, and black shoes.  Flashy jewelry, perfume and cologne are all to
be avoided.  Music should be put in a black folder or notebook of some
sort.
