The Stanford Chorus is open to all students, faculty, staff and any other
residents of the community interested in singing wonderful music. 
New members will be
auditioned prior to the first rehearsal of each quarter.
The purpose of the audition is <Em>not</Em> to weed people
out;  rather it
gives our director a chance to get to know the voices which will comprise
the Chorus.


<p>Members who are not students or faculty pay a modest (currently $25)
 participation
fee. This money helps to offset expenses, the largest of which is hiring
orchestras.

The music to be performed can be purchased at the Stanford Bookstore on 
the <A HREF =
"http://www.stanford.edu/map/campus-map.html">Stanford Campus</A> or
(usually) at the first couple rehearsals.
This quarter's concert (Winter, 1996) will be an all-Beethoven affair.  It
will open with the <Em>Egmont Overture</Em>.  We will then perform
<Em>Meeresstille und gl&uuml;ckliche Fahrt</Em> and the <Em> Mass in
C</Em>,
joined by soloists Kristin Genis, soprano, Claire Giovannetti,
mezzo-soprano,
Greg Wait, tenor, and Perry Cook, baritone.

Rehearsals are generaly held Monday evenings from 7:15 to 9:45 in Campbell
Recital Hall.  In addition there are usually some (optional) sectional
rehearsals on Wednesday afternoons.  Just before the
performance we have two "dress rehearsals" (concert dress is not required
or even recommended at these rehearsals), also mandatory, when we rehearse
 with the orchestra,
usually in the hall in which we will be performing. Other rehearsals are
accompanied by piano only.
<P> Members may miss up to three mandatory 
rehearsals.  Members who miss more mandatory rehearsals without prior
arrangement with the director will not be able to participate in the 
performance.
