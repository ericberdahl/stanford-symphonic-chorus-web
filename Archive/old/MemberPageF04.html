Joining the Chorus
</a>
</h2>
<p>
The Stanford Chorus is open to all students, faculty, staff and any other
residents of the community interested in singing wonderful music,
just like <a href="Singers.html">these folks.</a></p>
<p>
New member auditions for non-students will be held Thursday,
23 September from 6-10 PM and Saturday, 25 September from 11 AM to 2 PM.
Contact Stephen Sano at sano@stanford.edu or (650) 723-1570 to
schedule an audition.  If you are unable to make either of these times,
come to the first rehearsal of the quarter, 27 September 2004 at 7:15-9:45 
in Campbell Recital Hall (Braun Music Center).  There will be audition 
sign-ups posted at this rehearsal.</p>

<p>

Auditions prior to the first rehearsal for Stanford students take place: 9
a.m.-5 p.m. Monday, 27 September.  If you are unable to audition during
this time, come to the first rehearsal that Monday evening at 7:15 p.m. in
Campbell Recital Hall.  If you are unable to make the first rehearsal,
additional auditions will take place from 9 a.m.-9 p.m. Tuesdsay and
Wednesday, 28-29 September.  All audition signups for Stanford students
will be posted on the door of Braun Music Center room 119 starting on
Monday, 20 September.

</p>
<!--
Those interested in joining the chorus should come to the first rehearsal
of the quarter (usually approximately registration day) at 7:15-9:45 
in Campbell Recital
Hall (Braun Music Center).  There will be audition sign-ups posted 
at this rehearsal. -->

<p>Members who are not students or faculty pay a modest (currently $30)
 participation
fee. This money helps to offset expenses, the largest of which is hiring
orchestras.
<p>


<h2><a name="Music">Music</a></h2>

<h3><a name="ObMusic">Obtaining Music</a>
</h3>
<p>
The music to be performed is always available at the first couple rehearsals.
Often it can be purchased at the
 Stanford Bookstore on 
the <a href =
"http://www.stanford.edu/home/visitors/maps.html">Stanford Campus</a>.


 <!-- The total cost for music this
quarter (Fall, 2002) is $18.00 (rounded up $0.19 to avoid hassles
with change). -->

</p>

<!--
<p>To speed things up, you might want to print out this 
<a href="SSCregS02.html">registration
page</a> or this <a href="SSCregS02.pdf">pdf version</a>
and fill it out before you come to the first rehearsal.</p>
-->

<h3><a name=Program>Current Progam</a>
</h3>
<p>
This quarter's (Fall, 2004) includes
<ul>
<li> <em>Interlude </em>, Takeo Kudo   (no chorus)
</li>
<li> <em>Psalm 114 </em>, Felix Mendelssohn 
</li>
<li> <em>Psalm 114 </em>, Ernest Bloch  (no chorus)
</li>
<li> <em>Psalm 150 </em>, Anton Bruckner
</li>
<li> <em>Requiem Ebraico</em> (Psalm 92), Erich Zeisl
</li>
</ul>

<p>You may purchase the music at the first rehearsal.</p>

<h2><a name="Rehearsals">Rehearsals</a>
</h2>
Rehearsals are held Monday evenings from 7:15 to 9:45 in Campbell
Recital Hall in the Braun Music Building, but please be <em>early</em>
for the first one, since it will take extra time
to get everyone signed up and to distribute the music, which will be
available at the rehearsal.
Sign ups start at <strong>6:30 PM.</strong>

<p>
In addition there are usually some optional sectional
rehearsals on Wednesday afternoons.  Just before the
performance we typically have two
&quot;dress rehearsals&quot;, also mandatory,
	   when we rehearse with the orchestra,
usually in the hall in which we will be performing.
Concert dress is not required or even recommended at these rehearsals.
Other rehearsals are typically accompanied by piano only.
</p>	
<p> Members may miss up to two mandatory 
rehearsals.  Members who miss more than two mandatory rehearsals without prior
arrangement with the director will not be able to participate in the 
performance.

<h3>Parking</h3>
Parking for rehearsals can usually be found in the large lot closest to
Braun (and Tresidder).

<h2><a name="Performances">Performances</a>
</h2>
There are three performances this quarter:  Thursday, Nov. 18 (evening),
Sunday, Nov. 21 (matinee), Monday, Nov. 22 9evening). The first two
are in Memorial Church; the last is at Temple Emanu-El in San&nbsp;Francisco.


<h3><a name="Dress">Concert Dress</a> </h3>Men wear tuxedos or a
tuxedo-like suits (i.e., black; not grey, brown or blue), black shoes and
socks. Women are all in black:  long dress, or long black skirt or slacks
with  long-sleeved (preferably) or short-sleeved black
blouse, and black shoes.  Please <strong> no sleeveless tops</strong> and
<strong>no flashy jewelry</strong>.

<h3><a name="Aroma">
Concert Aromas</a> </h3>
Several people in the chorus are particularly sensitive to scented
products such as perfume and
hair spray; all of us have to sing in close quarters and benefit by
having air to breathe which is as pure as possible.  On all rehearsal
days, and <em>especially</em> on dress rehearsal and performance days,
<strong>we request you do not use any such products.</strong>
For information about
scent-free alternatives, please contact Courtney Behm at
Courtney@ViewpointSolutions.com.

<h3><a name="Folder">Covering Your Music</a> </h3>
For performances music must be put in a black folder or
notebook, or bound with a black cover.  Don't wait until the last 
minute to find a cover which will be practical in performance!

<h2><a name="Expectations">Expectations</a></h2>

Each singer is expected to learn the music assigned for each rehearsal on
his or her own. Beyond the first reading of a work, rehearsal time will
be devoted to the development of ensemble sound, interpretation, and other
musical matters.  It is further expected that each singer will make a
reasonable effort to develop his or her own vocal skills, and will make
every effort to contribute in a positive manner to the work of the group.

<h2><a name="Tickets">Tickets</a></h2>
<p>Tickets are usually offered for sale at rehearsals starting roughly
a couple weeks before performancs.  They are also available at
the Stanford box office in Tresidder ((650) 725-ARTS) and at the door.</p>
