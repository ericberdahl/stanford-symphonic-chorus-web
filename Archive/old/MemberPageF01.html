The Stanford Chorus is open to all students, faculty, staff and any other
residents of the community interested in singing wonderful music.
New members will be
auditioned prior to or soon after the first rehearsal of each quarter.
To schedule an audition before the first rehearsal (preferable for
Fall Quarter at least) contact our director, Steve Sano, at
<a href=mailto:sano@leland.stanford.edu>sano@leland.stanford.edu</a>
If this isn't possible, simply come to the first rehearsal.
The purpose of the audition is <em>not</em> to weed people
out;  rather it
gives our director a chance to get to know the voices which will comprise
the Chorus.


<p>Members who are not students or faculty pay a modest (currently $30)
 participation
fee. This money helps to offset expenses, the largest of which is hiring
orchestras.

The music to be performed can be purchased at the Stanford Bookstore on 
the <a href =
"http://www.stanford.edu/home/visitors/maps.html">Stanford Campus</a> or
(usually) at the first couple rehearsals.

<p>
This quarter's (Fall, 2001) choral music is the
<strong>truly</strong> awesome Berlioz <em>Requiem</em>.



<a name="Rehearsals">
<h1 name="Rehearsals">Rehearsals
</h1></a>
Rehearsals are held Monday evenings from 7:15 to 9:45 in Campbell
Recital Hall in the Braun Music Building, but please be <em>early</em>
(no later than 7 PM) for the first one, since it will take extra time
to get everyone signed up and to distribute the music, which will be
available at the rehearsal as well as at the Stanford Bookstore.
<p>
In addition there are usually some optional sectional
rehearsals on Wednesday afternoons.  Just before the
performance we typically have two
&quot;dress rehearsals&quot;, also mandatory,
	   when we rehearse with the orchestra,
usually in the hall in which we will be performing.
Concert dress is not required or even recommended at these rehearsals.
Other rehearsals are typically accompanied by piano only.
</p>	
<p> Members may miss up to two mandatory 
rehearsals.  Members who miss more than two mandatory rehearsals without prior
arrangement with the director will not be able to participate in the 
performance.

<h2>Parking</h2>
Parking for rehearsals can usually be found in the large lot closest to
Braun (and Tresidder).

<a name="Performances">
<h1 name="Performances">Performances
</h1></a>
There are two performances this quarter on May 23 and May 25, 2001, in 
Memorial Church on the Stanford campus.

<a name=Dress><h2>Concert Dress </h2>  </a>Men wear tuxedos or a
tuxedo-like suits (i.e., black; not grey, brown or blue), black shoes and
socks. Women are all in black:  long black skirt or slacks, long-sleeved black
blouse, and black shoes.  Flashy jewelry, perfume and cologne are all to
be avoided.  Music must be put in a black folder or
notebook, or bound with a black cover.

<a name="Expectations">
<h1 name="Expectations">Expectations
</h1></a>

Each singer is expected to learn the music assigned for each rehearsal on
his or her own. Beyond the first reading of a work, rehearsal time will
be devoted to the development of ensemble sound, interpretation, and other
musical matters.  It is further expected that each singer will make a
reasonable effort to develop his or her own vocal skills, and will make
every effort to contribute in a positive manner to the work of the group.

<a name="Tickets">
<h1 name="Tickets">Tickets
</h1></a>
<p>Tickets are usually offered for sale at rehearsals starting roughly
a couple weeks before performancs.  They are also available at
the Stanford box office in Tresidder ((650) 725-ARTS) and at the door.</p>
