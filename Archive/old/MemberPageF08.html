Joining the Chorus
</a>
</h2>
<p>
The Stanford Symphonic Chorus 
is open to all students, faculty, staff and any other
residents of the community interested in singing wonderful music,
just like <a href="Singers.html">these folks.</a></p>
<p>Members who are not students or faculty pay a modest (currently $30)
 participation
fee. This money helps to offset expenses, the largest of which is hiring
orchestras.
</p>

<h3 id="Audition">Auditions</h3>
<p>
New members are accepted by audition at the beginning of each academic
quarter.
Auditions for fall, 2008, will take place on</p>
<ul>
 <li>Thursday, 18 September, 7:00 to 10:00 PM</li>
 <li>Saturday, 20 September, 10:00 AM to 1:00 PM </li></ul>
<p>Auditions take place in Braun Music Center, room 120.  Please contact
the director, Steve Sano (650-723-1570, sano@stanford.edu), to schedule a
specific audition time.</p>

<p>Auditions take about ten minutes, are very "user-friendly," and consist
of:</p>
<ul><li>
Vocalizing (singing scale passages, or similar) with piano support to
determine range.</li>

<li>Pitch memory exercises (we'll play three or four notes in sequence on the
piano, and you sing them back).</li>

<li>Picking pitches out of a chord texture (we play three pitches
simultaneously on the piano, and ask you to sing the top, middle, or
bottom).</li>

<li>Simple sight singing</li>

<li>30 seconds to a minute of a prepared song.  This can be anything that you
enjoy singing: art song, aria, musical theatre number, jazz tune, hymn
tune, children's song, or the ever popular choices of: first verse of "My
country 'tis of thee", Amazing Grace, Edelweiss, etc.</li></ul>




<h2><a name="Music">Music</a></h2>

<h3><a name="ObMusic">Obtaining Music</a>
</h3>
<p>
The music to be performed is always available at the first couple rehearsals.
Often it can be purchased at the
 Stanford Bookstore on 
the <a href =
"http://www.stanford.edu/home/visitors/maps.html">Stanford Campus</a>.

</p>

<!--
<p>To speed things up, you might want to print out this 
<a href="SSCregS02.html">registration
page</a> or this <a href="SSCregS02.pdf">pdf version</a>
and fill it out before you come to the first rehearsal.</p>
-->

<h3><a name="Program">Current Progam</a>
</h3>

<p>
This quarter (Fall '08) features a well-loved standard, Bernstein's
<em>Chichester Psalms</em>, and a new work written by local
composer Brian Holmes, <em>Amherst Requiem</em>.  Our performances
will be the world premiere.
</p>

<p>You may purchase the music at the first rehearsal.</p>


<h2><a name="Rehearsals">Rehearsals</a>
</h2>
Rehearsals are held Monday evenings from 7:15 to 9:45 in Campbell
Recital Hall in the Braun Music Building, but please be <em>early</em>
for the first one, since it will take extra time
to get everyone signed up and to distribute the music, which will be
available at the rehearsal.
Sign ups start at <strong>6:30 PM.</strong> 

<p>
In addition there are usually some optional sectional
rehearsals on Wednesday afternoons.  Just before the
performance we typically have two
&quot;dress rehearsals&quot;, also mandatory,
	   when we rehearse with the orchestra,
usually in the hall in which we will be performing.
Concert dress is not required or even recommended at these rehearsals.
Other rehearsals are typically accompanied by piano only.
</p>	
<p> 
Members may miss up to two mandatory rehearsals during the quarter. 
Members who miss more
than two mandatory rehearsals without prior arrangement with the director
will not be allowed to participate in the performance.
 You must notify the director in advance if for any reason
you must miss all or part of a rehearsal.  For those participating for
graded credit, every two unexcused absences may result in the lowering of
the final grade by one letter.

<h3>Parking</h3>
Parking for rehearsals can usually be found in the large lot closest to

 weekdays.  You may park for free in any pay or permit slot (except 
for disabled slots) for rehearsal. 

<h2><a name="Performances">Performances</a>
</h2>

<ul>
<li>Friday, November 21 at 8 PM </li>
<li>Sunday, November 23 at 1:30 PM </li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="Dress">Concert Dress</a> </h3>Men wear tuxedos or a
tuxedo-like suits (i.e., black; not grey, brown or blue), black shoes and
socks. Women are all in black:  long dress, or long black skirt or slacks
with  long-sleeved (preferably) or short-sleeved black
blouse, and black shoes.  Please <strong> no sleeveless tops</strong> and
<strong>no flashy jewelry</strong>.

<h3><a name="Aroma">
Concert Aromas</a> </h3>
Several people in the chorus are particularly sensitive to scented
products such as perfume and
hair spray; all of us have to sing in close quarters and benefit by
having air to breathe which is as pure as possible.  On all rehearsal
days, and <em>especially</em> on dress rehearsal and performance days,
<strong>we request you do not use any such products.</strong>
For information about
scent-free alternatives, please contact Courtney Behm at
Courtney@ViewpointSolutions.com.

<h3><a name="Folder">Covering Your Music</a> </h3>
For performances music must be put in a black folder or
notebook, or bound with a black cover.  Don't wait until the last 
minute to find a cover which will be practical in performance!

<h2><a name="Expectations">Expectations</a></h2>

Each singer is expected to learn the music assigned for each rehearsal on
his or her own. Beyond the first reading of a work, rehearsal time will
be devoted to the development of ensemble sound, interpretation, and other
musical matters.  It is further expected that each singer will make a
reasonable effort to develop his or her own vocal skills, and will make
every effort to contribute in a positive manner to the work of the group.

<h2><a name="Tickets">Tickets</a></h2>
<p>Tickets are usually offered for sale at rehearsals starting roughly
a couple weeks before performancse.  They are also available at
the Stanford Ticket Office (650-725-2787),
or at the door.</p>
