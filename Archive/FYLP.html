<h1>For Your Listening Pleasure</h1>
<p>
Beethoven's <em>Mass in C</em> op. 86 has never received the same recorded
attention as the <em>Missa solemnis</em>, but there are still several excellent
recordings to choose from.</p>
<p>
John Eliot Gardiner's reading (Archiv 435 391-2) is an easy first choice.
Both the singing and the orchestral playing are top-notch.  The Monteverdi
Choir sings with flawless choral blend, precision in diction and
intonation, and convincing phrasing&mdash;a joy to listen to.  The Orchestre
Révolutionaire et Romantique, utilizing period instruments, plays with
equal precision, and a vast palette of tonal color.  No thin sounding
strings or shrill winds here&mdash;just first-rank playing with an almost
fiendish energy.  The soloists are well up to the standards set by the
choir and orchestra.  The voices are a bit larger and more full-bodied
than in many "period" instrument recordings, and the color suits the music
perfectly.  Be advised that the orchestra tunes to A=415 rather than the
contemporary standard of A=440 so you won't be able to play this
recording and play your part along on your piano when you study.
</p><p>
Robert Shaw's 1990 recording (Telarc CD-80248) is a "big-band" performance
with precision and beauty of tone in both the singing and playing­­ and
more expansive tempi than Gardiner. The deliberate tempo of the Gloria (it
runs two-ahd-a-half minutes longer than Gardiner) is weighty and grand as
opposed to light and exuberant.  But, as always with Shaw, there is great
beauty in the performance, including wonderful contributions by all the
soloists.  The sound is typical Telarc, clean, round, no brittleness, but
with the chorus set a little further back in a rather gauzy acoustic.
</p><p>
Sir Thomas Beecham's 1959 recording has long been a yardstick of
measurement for performances of this work, and is available in a
budget-priced 2-CD set coupled with Beethoven's 2nd and 7th Symphonies CD
(EMI 0724358650426).  The Beecham Choral Society's singing is definitely
'50's vintage.  Their performance is colorful and meaty, if somewhat
lacking in the precision and perfect blend of Gardiner's forces.  The team
of soloists is evenly matched, and more operatic sounding than Gardiner's
quartet.  The performance has wonderful energy and pacing, with tempi
almost as crisp as Gardiner's.  The sonics are good, if slightly edgy and
brittle by contemporary standards.
</p><p>
Colin Davis' recording is available as part of a 2 CD set (Philips 438
362-2) with the <em>Missa solemnis</em> at a 2 for 1 price.  
Definitely a great way
to expand your Beethoven choral music collection.  The performance is
conservatively paced, but even the tempi that are slower than Shaw's have
a forward momentum that give direction and dramatic presence to the music.
The London Symphony Chorus' performance is mostly first-rate, both
technically and musically, with all sections well up to the task.  Only in
the Crucifixus, does the blend get rough.  Warm, vintage Philips analog
sound has been retained nicely on the CD.
</p><p>
Lighter-weight, intimate, and currently out-of-print, is George Guest's
performance with the St.&nbsp;John's College Choir, Cambridge (last in print as
London 430 361-2).  The pleasing clarity of the boys' voices allow for
well-delineated textures, and   though the grand
moments are sometimes lost due to the intimacy of the forces, this is a
lovely performance to own if you can find it.
