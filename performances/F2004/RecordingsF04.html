<h3>For Your Listening Pleasure<br />
Stanford Symphonic Chorus: Fall 2004</h3>
<p>Since some of you have asked for recommended recordings of the
repertoire we are working on this fall, here is a list of my
favorite:</p>
<p>All three choral works from this fall's program are readily
available on CD&mdash;though procuring some of them might take a little
longer than usual.</p>

<p>There are two recordings of Mendelssohn's Psalm 114 currently
available: Frieder Bernius conducting the Kammerchor Stuttgart with
the Deutsche Kammerphilharmonie (Carus 83.202), and Michel Corboz
conducting the Choeur &amp; Orchestre Gulbenkian de Lisbonne (Erato
4509-94359-2. Both are fine performances, Bernius is more taut
and lean with slightly brighter tempi. Textures are very cleanly
etched, and there is terrific flow and forward momentum to the
phrasing. The orchestral introduction to the first Allegro (m.
88) is immaculately played&mdash;stunning! Corboz is more lush and
expansive&mdash;more &quot;romantic&quot;. What this performance may
lack in momentum, is more than made up for with a a sense of breath
drama. The choral singing is fine in both performances, and both
are well-recorded, though the Corboz is a little &quot;mistier&quot;
in definition (and as a result, diction is slightly more difficult to
discern).</p>

<p>Bruckner's Psalm 150 is easier to find&mdash;and the piece(s) it's
coupled with on different CDs might well determine which version you
wish to purchase. Wonderfully successful (as would be expected!)
is Helmuth Rilling conducting the G=E4chinger Kantorei Stuttgart and
the Bach-Collegium Stuttgart (H=E4nssler 98.119, coupled with
Bruckner's Mass No. 2 in e minor and the Te Deum). The soprano
tone can be a bit &quot;screamy&quot; above the staff when singing at
big volumes (almost unavoidable when singing sustained high Bb above
full orchestra!), but the drama is winning&mdash;there's a reason we say
&quot;Rilling is thrilling&quot;! And nobody controls those
tutti luftpause like Maestro Rilling. :-)</p>

<p>One of the classic recordings of Bruckner's Psalm 150 is Eugen
Jochum conducting the Chor der Deutschen Oper Belin and the Berlin
Philharmoniker (Deutsche Grammophon 457 743-2, mid-priced and coupled
with the Te Deum and a generous selection of Bruckner's a cappella
motets). The choral singing is vintage; rich, full-throated,
colorful&mdash;and often without a real sense of &quot;blend&quot;
(neither vowel, vibrato, or timbre). In fact, in some of the
softer passages, the competing vibratos rather obscure the pitch. 
But, this is still a wonderful performance&mdash;passionate and
committed. Recorded in 1965, the sound also vintage DG: warm and
detailed analog with a terrific sense of space and depth.</p>

<p>If it's clean you want, it's clean you get with Matthew Best
conducting the Corydon Singers and Orchestra (Hyperion CDA66599). 
This is British Cathedral choir perfection (though a mixed choir of
all mature voices) delivering a controlled but never staid
performance. Wonderful choral tone, exacting attention to detail
in diction and ensemble, and the best recorded sound of the three
Bruckner CDs on this list.</p>

<p>There is only one recording of Erich Zeisl's Requiem Ebraico, and
it can be

ordered from AmazonUK</a>
although, be advised that it may take 4-6 weeks for
delivery.</p>

<p>Lawrence Foster conducts the Rundfunk Sinfonieorchester und Chor
Belin (Decca 460 211-2) and the piece is coupled with Franz Waxman's
haunting Das Lied von Terezin. Though this setting of the 92nd
Psalm was originally composed in English, this recording is in Hebrew,
as we will perform it. Note also, that although the text in the
score is transliterated in Hebrew as it would have been spoken in
pre-war, Eastern Europe, we will perform the work in modern Hebrew -
and this recording is also in modern Hebrew. The sweep and
emotion of the performance is gripping, and the soloists (baritone
Michael Kraus, in particular) are appropriately cantorial.</p>
