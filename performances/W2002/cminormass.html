<h3 align="center">A Preface To The <em>C-Minor Mass</em></h3>
<p>It is an unfortunate and rather ironic fact
that what are generally considered to be Mozart's two greatest choral works-
the <em>C-minor Mass</em> and the <em>Requiem</em>- were both left unfinished.
In fact, with Mozart's reputation for being one who wrote quickly and with
little effort, we in the choral world might complain of unfair treatment.
After all, our opera neighbors don't have to put up with stuff like this.
Imagine if the man had just decided to stop composing with Pamina
and Tamino wandering around in the fire and water-what kind of ending would
that have been?</p>
<p>With the <em>Requiem</em>, we have to grant that
Mozart had a pretty good excuse for not finishing (he died). Anyway,
since there was money riding on its getting done, his wife went out and
found somebody else to get the work across the finish line, meaning that
while it isn't all Mozart, we at least have a complete piece. We
are less fortunate with the <em>C-minor Mass</em> (there was no money
hinging on its completion), and more justified in feeling slighted that
Mozart never got around to finishing it.</p>
<p>While Mozart's earlier Mass settings for Salzburg
had been brief works with through-composed movements (the Archbishop apparently
didn't go for long services), in the <em>C-minor Mass</em> he divided
the longer tests into several distinct movements, alternating extended
choirs (up to five and eight voices) with melodious and/or virtuosic solos
and ensembles to create a cantata-like form reminiscent of Bach's <em>B-minor
Mass</em>. As for inspiration, it seems that Mozart had sworn- be
it to God, himself, his father, or someone else- to compose a Thanksgiving
Mass if dear old dad would forgive him for marrying Constanze (Leopold
apparently wasn't a big Constanze fan). In any event, he began work
on the project in the fall and winter of 1782, and by early 1783 he had
set the complete texts of the <em>Kyrie</em> and <em>Gloria</em>, as well as
the first two parts of the <em>Credo</em>. Mozart was more or less
obligated to perform the Mass during his visit to Salzburg in the summer
and early autumn of 1783, and even though he put it off until his last
day in town (I'm not making this up), he still only managed to add the
<em>Sanctus</em> and <em>Benedictus</em>. Although he had only an incomplete
Credo and no Agnus Dei whatsoever, Mozart kept his word and put the thing
on just the same. Just how he got around this during the performance
we still don't really know, but whatever happened, this was the work's
first and only performance during his lifetime (Constanze sang all the
big soprano solos to show Leopold that he was wrong about her). After
that, Mozart put the score away and never worked on it again.</p>
<p>He did, however, steal some big chunks of the
Mass in 1785 for a now-obscure Italian cantata 'Davide penitente', and
it was in this form that the music of the <em>C-minor Mass
</em>became popular in the nineteenth century. Its genesis as
a Mass composition was forgotten until the early years of the twentieth
century. At that point, in looking at the sources someone realized
that although both the <em>Sanctus</em> and the <em>Hosanna in excelsis </em>had
been written down as four-part choral settings, their musical substance
implied a double-choir and double-fugue, respectively. (Just why Mozart
might have wanted one thing and wrote down another is kind of complicated-
let's just take the musicologist's word on this.) Anyway, the manuscript
has been lost since WWII, so these particular movements were "reconstructed"
by H.C. Robbins Landon between 1953 and 1955, making them "intellectual
property". To summarize, it's all Mozart's fault.</p>
