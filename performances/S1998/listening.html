<h1>For Your Listening Pleasure</h1>

The following reviews on recordings of works performed by the Stanford
Symphonic Chorus have been provided by the director, Steve Sano.

<A NAME="SeaSymph">
<h2><em>A Sea Symphony</em> by Ralph Vaughan Williams</h2></A>
<p>
Happily, there are a good number of excellent recordings of all of Ralph
Vaughan Williams symphonies.  His first symphony, <em>A Sea Symphony,</em>
was completed in 1909.  A vast and majestic work of grand proportions,
it is composed in the typical symphonic four movements and sets wonderful
text by Walt Whitman.
</p>
<p> For the strongest recordins in the catalog, one would logically turn
to conductors from the UK, and in this instance the results are most
pleasing.  Sir Adrian Boult recorded this work twice, once in 1954 and
again in 1968, both times with the London Philharmonic Orchestra and
Choir.  A champion of Vaughan Williams' music, Boult premiered RVW's
third, fourth, and sixth sympohnies.  His later recording of <em>A Sea
Symphony</em> (EMI CDM 64016 2) is still one of the finest available.
THere is always a keen sense of large-scale shape and direction, and tempi
are never overly sentimental.  Both chorus and orchestra are excellent
(except for the first exclamation of the word "sea" that doesn't quite
tune will into the chord), as are the soloists Sheila Armstrong and John
Carol Case.  Particularaly lovely are the extended duet passages in the
last movement.  Though the sound is somewhat close, the overall effect is
clean and powerful.  Boult's earlier mono recording (London 425 658-2)
is a wonderful reference point--the composer was present at the
recording sessions.  A young, and, perhaps, "hotter" reading.
</p>
<p>
For an equally successful, though quite different experience, Bryden
Thomson's
recording (Chandos CHAN 8764) is a winner.  Compelling and evocative,
Thomson conducs a more expansive performance than Boult.  Still, this is
a reading that is never lacking in energy and excitement whwere needed.
The London Symphony Orchestra and Chorus are in top form, and the choral
singing is cleaner and more polished than in either of Boults's
recordings.
Baritone soloist Brian Rayner Cook is outstanding, with the right
combination of
heft and lyricism.  Sonically, this is the finest of all available
recordings -- warm, rich, with exquisite detail and an almost uncanny
depth to the soundstage.  The opening of the first movement in this
recording is truly audiophile demonstration stuff!</p>
<p>
Fans of baritone Thomas Hampson can hear him on Teldec's offering
(Teldec 4509-94550-2) conducted by Andrew Davis.  With this recording
the BBC Symphony Chorus and Orchestra, the third of the "Big Three"
London choir and orchestra combinations, are given their chance to shine.
With tempi that are slightly more brisk, this reading is full of energy
and verve.  One curious point is the recording itself that sounds at the
same time close and somewhat woolly--perhaps made more apparent if one
listens to this recording immediately following the previous Chandos disc.</p>
<p>
A young Andr&eacute; Previn conducts a young RVW on RCA's recording (RCA
60580-2-RG).  Lojng a strong recommendation in the catalog, this
performance retains its freshness almost thirty years after it was
recorded.
Again, the London Symphony ORchestra and Chorus give an idiomatically
spirited and colorful performance.  HEather Harper and John Shirley-Quirk
are simple and tender in their last movement pairing.</p>
<p>
Other strong recordings include Vernon Handley conducting the Liverpool
Philharmonic Orchestra and Chorus (Virgin VJ 759687-4), and Bernard
Haitink conducting the London Philharmonic Choir and Orchestra (EMI CDC7
49911-2).</p>
<p>
Note the distinct lack of any non-British orchestra or chorus in the
listings above. </p>
