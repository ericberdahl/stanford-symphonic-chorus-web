				<p>Members must register online for the Fall 2013 quarter.</p>
				<p>
					After submitting the online form, you will receive an email
					confirmation. Please be sure to print that email confirmation and
					bring it with you to your first rehearsal, along with cash or check
					(made out to Stanford University) for any fees or music. If you do
					not receive the confirmation right away, check your Junk folder to
					be sure it didn't get caught as spam.<br />
				</p>
				

				<!-- <p>Scores cost $11 and may be purchased at the first rehearsal.</p> -->

				<p>Registration fee is $40 (waived for students and faculty).</p>
				<p>By the request of our cantor, Stephen Saxon, we will be
					performing Bloch&rsquo;s Sacred Service in Sephardic Hebrew rather than
					the printed Ashkenazi. To facilitate this, the Department of Music
					is producing modified scores with the new text by special license
					from the publisher. All SSC members will need to rent one of these
					scores; the changes are too extensive to make modifying an existing
					vocal score feasible. The rental fee of $21 covers both the
					licensing fee and cost of production. You are welcome to mark the
					score in pencil or highlight your vocal part. The scores must be
					returned at the end of the quarter, and will be numbered at
					check-out to facilitate this process.</p>

			<p>The Stanford Symphonic Chorus is open to all students,
				faculty, staff and any other residents of the community interested
				in singing wonderful music.</p>
			<p>Members who are not students or faculty pay a modest
				(currently $40) participation fee. This money helps to offset
				expenses, the largest of which is hiring orchestras.</p>

			<h3 id="auditions">Auditions</h3>
			<p>
				New members are accepted by audition at the beginning of each academic quarter.  Auditions are scheduled for Saturday, 21 September, from 10:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m.  Please email <script type="text/javascript">unScramble("sano","stanford.educator","Stephen Sano","Regarding auditions");</script> at

<p>New members are accepted by audition at the beginning of each academic quarter. To schedule an audition, please attend our first rehearsal on Monday, September 23rd to sign up for a specific audition time. If you are unable to attend, please email <script type="text/javascript">unScramble("sano","stanford.educator","Stephen Sano","Regarding auditions");</script> at

<!--Auditions for Fall 2012 take place Thursday, 20 September 7-10 p.m. and Saturday, 22 September, 10 a.m.-1 p.m. Auditions take place in Braun Music Center, room 120. 
  Please contact the director, <script type="text/javascript">unScramble("sano","stanford.educator","Stephen Sano","Regarding auditions");</script>  <noscript>Stephen Sano: sano/AT/stanford/DOT/-e-d-u-/</noscript> 
  (650-723-1570 or <script type="text/javascript">unScramble("sano","stanford.educator","sano@stanford.edu");</script> <noscript>
  </noscript>  ), to schedule a specific audition time.</p>  -->


<p>Auditions take about ten minutes, are very "user-friendly," and consist of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vocalizing (singing scale passages, or similar) with piano support to determine range.</li>
<li>Pitch memory exercises (we'll play three or four notes in sequence on the piano, and you sing them back).</li>
<li>Picking pitches out of a chord texture (we play three pitches simultaneously on the piano, and ask you to sing the highest, middle, or lowest pitch).</li>
<li>Simple sight singing</li>
<li>30 seconds to a minute of a prepared song. This can be anything that you enjoy singing: art song, aria, musical theatre number, jazz tune, hymn tune, children's song, or the ever popular choices of: first verse of <em>My country 'tis of thee,</em> <em>Amazing Grace,</em> <em>Edelweiss,</em> etc.
</li>
</ul>

<!-- PUT UP 9/22  TWO OF TWO THIS PAGE
We'll have sign-up sheets with specific audition times, based on Jim's availability, at the first two rehearsals. Those will probably be scheduled for: after the 9/23 rehearsal; before and after the 9/30 rehearsal; and in the evening on 10/1.

        <li><a href="c5">Concert Dress</a></li>

      </ul>
    </div> -->
				<h3 id="c4">Learning the Music</h3>
				<p>Each singer is expected to learn the music assigned for each
					rehearsal on his or her own. Beyond the first reading of a work,
					rehearsal time will be devoted to the development of ensemble
					sound, interpretation, and other musical matters. It is further
					expected that each singer will make a reasonable effort to develop
					his or her own vocal skills, and will make every effort to
					contribute in a positive manner to the work of the group.</p>
				<h3 id="c5">Concert Dress</h3>
				<p>
					Men wear tuxedos or a tuxedo-like suits (i.e., black; not grey,
					brown or blue), white shirt, black bow tie, black shoes and socks.
					Women wear all black: long dress, or long black skirt or slacks
					with long-sleeved (preferably) or short-sleeved black blouse, and
					black shoes. Please <strong>no sleeveless tops</strong> and <strong>no
						flashy jewelry.</strong>
				</p>
				<h3 id="c6">Covering Your Music</h3>
				<p>
					For performances music must be put in a black folder or notebook,
					or bound with a black cover. Don't wait until the last minute to
					find a cover which will be practical in performance! (See <a
						href="#folders">Music Folders</a> on this page for resources.)
				</p>

				<h3 id="Aroma">
					<a href="nofragrance.html">Fragrance-Free Policy</a>
				</h3>
				<p>
					Several people in the chorus are particularly sensitive to scented
					products such as perfume and hair spray; all of us have to sing in
					close quarters and benefit by having air to breathe which is as
					pure as possible. On all rehearsal days, and especially on dress
					rehearsal and performance days, we request you do not use any such
					products. For further information, including information on
					obtaining scent-free alternatives, see <a href="nofragrance.html">extensive
						guidelines.</a>
				</p>

				<a name="Schedule" id="Schedule"></a>
				<h2 id="c7">Rehearsals</h2>
				<p>
					Rehearsals are held Monday evenings from 7:15 to 9:45 in Campbell
					Recital Hall in the Braun Music Building, but please be <em>early</em>
					for the first rehearsal, since it will take extra time to get
					everyone signed up and to distribute the music, which will be
					available at the rehearsal. Sign ups start at <strong>6:15
						p.m.</strong>
				</p>

				<p>In addition, there are optional sectional
					rehearsals on selected Tuesday evenings from 6:15 to 7:15. Just before
					the performance we typically have two &ldquo;dress
					rehearsals,&rdquo; also mandatory, when we rehearse with the
					orchestra, usually in the hall in which we will be performing.
					Concert dress is not required or even recommended at these
					rehearsals. Other rehearsals are typically accompanied by piano
					only.</p>

				<p>Members may miss up to two required rehearsals during the
					quarter. Members who miss more than two required rehearsals without
					prior arrangement with the director will not be allowed to
					participate in the performance. You must notify the director in
					advance if for any reason you must miss all or part of a rehearsal.
					For those participating for graded credit, every two unexcused
					absences may result in the lowering of the final grade by one
					letter.</p>

				<h3>Music</h3>
				<p>The music to be performed is always available at the first
					two rehearsals. For Fall 2013 it will  be provided <em>only</em> in rehearsals. (See "Member Tools" in the side panel.)<!-- It can also be purchased at the Stanford Bookstore
					on the Stanford Campus, downstairs in the textbook section under
					Music 162. --> </p>

				<h3>Parking</h3>
				<p>Parking for rehearsals can usually be found in the large lot
					on Mayfield Avenue closest to Braun (and Tresidder Student Union).
					There is no parking enforcement after 4 p.m. on weekdays. You may
					park for free in any pay or permit slot (except for disabled slots)
					for rehearsal.</p>
